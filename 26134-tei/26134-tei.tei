<head>The Codex</head>

<p>
[Transcriber's Note: This e-book contains much Greek text which is central
to the point of the book.  In the ASCII versions of the e-book, the Greek
is transliterated into Roman letters, which do not perfectly represent the
Greek original; especially, accent and breathing marks do not transliterate.
The HTML and PDF versions contain the true Greek text of the original book.]
</p>

<p>
On the next page is exhibited an <hi rend='italic'>exact Fac-simile</hi>, obtained
by Photography, of fol. 28 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi> of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Codex
Sinaiticus</hi> at S. Petersburg, (Tischendorf's א): shewing the abrupt termination
of S. Mark's Gospel at the words ΕΦΟΒΟΥΝΤΟ ΓΑΡ
(chap. xvi. 8), as explained at p. <ref target="Pg070">70</ref>, and pp.
<ref target="Pg086">86-8</ref>. The
original Photograph, which is here reproduced on a diminished
scale, measures in height full fourteen inches and
one-eighth; in breadth, full thirteen inches. It was procured
for me through the friendly and zealous offices of the
English Chaplain at S. Petersburg, the Rev. A. S. Thompson,
B.D.; by favour of the Keeper of the Imperial Library, who
has my hearty thanks for his liberality and consideration.
</p>

<p>
It will be perceived that the text begins at S. Mark xvi. 2,
and ends with the first words of S. Luke i. 18.
</p>

<p>
Up to this hour, every endeavour to obtain a Photograph
of the corresponding page of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Codex Vaticanus</hi>, B,
(No. 1209, in the Vatican,) has proved unavailing. If the
present Vindication of the genuineness of Twelve Verses of
the everlasting Gospel should have the good fortune to approve
itself to his Holiness, <hi rend="smallcaps">Pope Pius IX.</hi>, let me be permitted
in this unadorned and unusual manner,&mdash;(to which
I would fain add some circumstance of respectful ceremony
if I knew how,)&mdash;very humbly to entreat his Holiness to
allow me to possess a Photograph, corresponding in size
with the original, of the page of <hi rend="smallcaps">Codex B</hi> (it is numbered
fol. 1303,) which exhibits the abrupt termination of the
Gospel according to S. Mark.

<head>Dedication: To Sir Roundell Palmer, Q.C., M.P.</head>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Dear Sir Roundell</hi>,
</p>

<p>
I do myself the honour of inscribing this volume to you. Permit
me to explain the reason why.
</p>

<p>
It is not merely that I may give expression to a sentiment of
private friendship which dates back from the pleasant time when
I was Curate to your Father,&mdash;whose memory I never recall
without love and veneration;&mdash;nor even in order to afford myself
the opportunity of testifying how much I honour you for the
noble example of conscientious uprightness and integrity which
you set us on a recent public occasion. It is for no such reason
that I dedicate to you this vindication of the last Twelve Verses
of the Gospel according to S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
It is because I desire supremely to submit the argument contained
in the ensuing pages to a practised judicial intellect of the
loftiest stamp. Recent Editors of the New Testament insist that
these <q>last Twelve Verses</q> are not genuine. The Critics, almost
to a man, avow themselves of the same opinion. Popular Prejudice
has been for a long time past warmly enlisted on the same side.
I am as convinced as I am of my life, that the reverse is the
truth. It is not even with me as it is with certain learned
friends of mine, who, admitting the adversary's premisses, content
themselves with denying the validity of his inference. However
true it may be,&mdash;and it is true,&mdash;that from those premisses
the proposed conclusion does not follow, I yet venture to deny the
correctness of those premisses altogether. I insist, on the contrary,
<pb n="vi"/><anchor id="Pgvi"/>
that the Evidence relied on is untrustworthy,&mdash;untrustworthy
in every particular.
</p>

<p>
How, in the meantime, can such an one as I am hope to
persuade the world that it is as I say, while the most illustrious
Biblical Critics at home and abroad are agreed, and against me?
Clearly, the first thing to be done is to secure for myself a full
and patient hearing. With this view, I have written a book.
But next, instead of waiting for the slow verdict of Public
Opinion, (which yet, I know, must come after many days,) I
desiderate for the Evidence I have collected, a competent and an
impartial Judge. And <emph>that</emph> is why I dedicate my book to you.
If I can but get this case fairly tried, I have no doubt whatever
about the result.
</p>

<p>
Whether you are able to find time to read these pages, or not,
it shall content me to have shewn in this manner the confidence
with which I advocate my cause; the kind of test to which I
propose to bring my reasonings. If I may be allowed to say so,&mdash;<emph>S. Mark's
last Twelve Verses shall no longer remain a
subject of dispute among men.</emph> I am able to prove that
this portion of the Gospel has been declared to be spurious on
wholly mistaken grounds: and this ought in fairness to close
the discussion. But I claim to have done more. I claim to have
shewn, from considerations which have been hitherto overlooked,
that its genuineness must needs be reckoned among the things
that are absolutely certain.
</p>

<p>
I am, with sincere regard and respect,<lb/>
Dear Sir Roundell,<lb/>
Very faithfully yours,<lb/>
JOHN W. BURGON.

<head>Preface.</head>

<p>
This volume is my contribution towards the better
understanding of a subject which is destined,
when it shall have grown into a Science, to vindicate
for itself a mighty province, and to enjoy paramount
attention. I allude to the Textual Criticism
of the New Testament Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
That this Study is still in its infancy, all may see.
The very principles on which it is based are as yet
only imperfectly understood. The reason is obvious.
It is because the very foundations have not yet been
laid, (except to a wholly inadequate extent,) on which
the future superstructure is to rise. A careful collation
of every extant Codex, (executed after the manner
of the Rev. F. H. Scrivener's labours in this department,)
is the first indispensable preliminary to
any real progress. Another, is a revised Text, not to
say a more exact knowledge, of the oldest Versions.
Scarcely of inferior importance would be critically
correct editions of the Fathers of the Church; and
these must by all means be furnished with far completer
Indices of Texts than have ever yet been attempted.&mdash;There
is not a single Father to be named
whose Works have been hitherto furnished with even
a tolerably complete Index of the places in which he
<pb n="viii"/><anchor id="Pgviii"/>
either quotes, or else clearly refers to, the Text of the
New Testament: while scarcely a tithe of the known
MSS. of the Gospels have as yet been satisfactorily
collated. Strange to relate, we are to this hour without
so much as a satisfactory Catalogue of the Copies
which are known to be extant.
</p>

<p>
But when all this has been done,&mdash;(and the Science
deserves, and requires, a little more public encouragement
than has hitherto been bestowed on the arduous
and&mdash;let me not be ashamed to add the word&mdash;<emph>unremunerative</emph>
labour of Textual Criticism,)&mdash;it will be
discovered that the popular and the prevailing Theory
is a mistaken one. The plausible hypothesis on which
recent recensions of the Text have been for the most
part conducted, will be seen to be no longer tenable.
The latest decisions will in consequence be generally
reversed.
</p>

<p>
I am not of course losing sight of what has been
already achieved in this department of Sacred Learning.
While our knowledge of the uncial MSS. has been
rendered tolerably exact and complete, an excellent
beginning has been made, (chiefly by the Rev.
F. H. Scrivener, the most judicious living Master
of Textual Criticism,) in acquainting us with the contents
of about seventy of the cursive MSS. of the New
Testament. And though it is impossible to deny that
the published Texts of Doctors Tischendorf and Tregelles
as <emph>Texts</emph> are wholly inadmissible, yet is it
equally certain that by the conscientious diligence
with which those distinguished Scholars have respectively
<pb n="ix"/><anchor id="Pgix"/>
laboured, they have erected monuments of their
learning and ability which will endure for ever. Their
Editions of the New Testament will not be superseded
by any new discoveries, by any future advances
in the Science of Textual Criticism. The MSS. which
they have edited will remain among the most precious
materials for future study. All honour to them!
If in the warmth of controversy I shall appear to
have spoken of them sometimes without becoming
deference, let me here once for all confess that I am
to blame, and express my regret. When they have
publicly begged S. Mark's pardon for the grievous
wrong they have done <emph>him</emph>, I will very humbly beg
their pardon also.
</p>

<p>
In conclusion, I desire to offer my thanks to the
Rev. John Wordsworth, late Fellow of Brasenose College,
for his patient perusal of these sheets as they
have passed through the press, and for favouring me
with several judicious suggestions. To him may be
applied the saying of President Routh on receiving
a visit from Bishop Wordsworth at his lodgings,&mdash;<q>I
see the learned son of a learned Father, sir!</q>&mdash;Let
me be permitted to add that my friend inherits
the Bishop's fine taste and accurate judgment also.
</p>

<p>
And now I dismiss this Work, at which I have
conscientiously laboured for many days and many
nights; beginning it in joy and ending it in sorrow.
The College in which I have for the most part written
it is designated in the preamble of its Charter and
in its Foundation Statutes, (which are already much
<pb n="x"/><anchor id="Pgx"/>
more than half a thousand years old,) as <hi rend='italic'>Collegium
Scholarium in Sacrâ Theologiâ studentium,&mdash;perpetuis
temporibus duraturum</hi>. Indebted, under <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, to the
pious munificence of the Founder of Oriel for my
opportunities of study, I venture, in what I must
needs call evil days, to hope that I have to some
extent <q>employed my advantages,</q>&mdash;(the expression
occurs in a prayer used by this Society on its
three solemn anniversaries,)&mdash;as our Founder and
Benefactors <q>would approve if they were now upon
earth to witness what we do.</q>

<head>THE CASE OF THE LAST TWELVE VERSES
OF S. MARK'S GOSPEL, STATED.</head>

<quote rend="display">
These Verses generally suspected at the present time. The popularity
of this opinion accounted for.
</quote>

<p>
It has lately become the fashion to speak of the last Twelve
Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark, as if it were
an ascertained fact that those verses constitute no integral
part of the Gospel. It seems to be generally supposed, (1)
That the evidence of MSS. is altogether fatal to their claims;
(2) That <q>the early Fathers</q> witness plainly against their
genuineness; (3) That, from considerations of <q>internal
evidence</q> they must certainly be given up. It shall be my
endeavour in the ensuing pages to shew, on the contrary,
That manuscript evidence is so overwhelmingly in their
favour that no room is left for doubt or suspicion:&mdash;That
there is not so much as <emph>one</emph> of the Fathers, early or late,
who gives it as his opinion that these verses are spurious:&mdash;and,
That the argument derived from internal considerations
proves on inquiry to be baseless and unsubstantial as
a dream.
</p>

<p>
But I hope that I shall succeed in doing more. It shall
be my endeavour to shew not only that there really is no
reason whatever for calling in question the genuineness of
this portion of Holy Writ, but also that there exist sufficient
reasons for feeling confident that it must needs be
genuine. This is clearly as much as it is possible for me
<pb n="002"/><anchor id="Pg002"/>
to achieve. But when this has been done, I venture to hope
that the verses in dispute will for the future be allowed to
retain their place in the second Gospel unmolested.
</p>

<p>
It will of course be asked,&mdash;And yet, if all this be so,
how does it happen that both in very ancient, and also in
very modern times, this proposal to suppress twelve verses
of the Gospel has enjoyed a certain amount of popularity?
At the two different periods, (I answer,) for widely different
reasons.
</p>

<p>
(1.) In the ancient days, when it was the universal belief
of Christendom that the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> must needs be consistent
with itself in every part, and prove in every part
(like its Divine Author) perfectly <q>faithful and true,</q> the
difficulty (which was deemed all but insuperable) of bringing
certain statements in S. Mark's last Twelve Verses into
harmony with certain statements of the other Evangelists,
is discovered to have troubled Divines exceedingly. <q>In
fact,</q> (says Mr. Scrivener,) <q>it brought suspicion upon these
verses, and caused their omission in some copies seen by
Eusebius.</q> That the maiming process is indeed attributable
to this cause and came about in this particular way, I am
unable to persuade myself; but, if the desire to provide an
escape from a serious critical difficulty did not actually
<emph>occasion</emph> that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were mutilated, it
certainly was the reason why, in very early times, such
mutilated copies were viewed without displeasure by some,
and appealed to with complacency by others.
</p>

<p>
(2.) But times are changed. We have recently been
assured on high authority that the Church has reversed her
ancient convictions in this respect: that <emph>now</emph>, <q>most sound
theologians have no dread whatever of acknowledging minute
points of disagreement</q> (i.e. minute <emph>errors</emph>) <q>in the fourfold
narrative even of the life of the Redeemer.</q><note place="foot">Abp. Tait's
<hi rend='italic'>Harmony of Revelation and the Sciences</hi>, (1864,) p. 21.</note>
There has arisen in these last days a singular impatience of Dogmatic
Truth, (especially Dogma of an unpalatable kind,)
which has even rendered popular the pretext afforded by
these same mutilated copies for the grave resuscitation of
doubts, never as it would seem seriously entertained by any
<pb n="003"/><anchor id="Pg003"/>
of the ancients; and which, at all events for 1300 years and
upwards, have deservedly sunk into oblivion.
</p>

<p>
Whilst I write, <emph>that</emph> <q>most divine explication of the
chiefest articles of our Christian belief,</q> the Athanasian
Creed,<note place="foot">See by all means Hooker, E. P., v. xlii. 11-13.</note>
is made the object of incessant assaults.<note place="foot">Abp. Tait is of opinion
that it <q>should not retain its place in the public
Service of the Church:</q> and Dean Stanley gives sixteen reasons for the
same opinion,&mdash;the fifteenth of which is that <q>many excellent laymen, including
King George III., have declined to take part in the recitation.</q>
(<hi rend='italic'>Final</hi>) <hi rend='italic'>Report of the Ritual Commission</hi>,
1870, p. viii. and p. xvii.</note>
But then it is remembered that statements quite as <q>uncharitable</q>
as any which this Creed contains are found in the 16th
verse of S. Mark's concluding chapter; are in fact the words
of Him whose very Name is Love. The precious <emph>warning
clause</emph>, I say, (miscalled <q>damnatory,</q><note place="foot">In the words of a
thoughtful friend, (Rev. C. P. Eden),&mdash;<q><emph>Condemnatory</emph>
is just what these clauses are not. I understand myself, in uttering these
words, not to condemn a fellow creature, but to acknowledge a truth of Scripture,
<hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> judgment namely on the sin of unbelief. The
further question,&mdash;In whom the sin of unbelief is found; <emph>that</emph>
awful question I leave entirely in His hands who is the alone Judge of hearts;
who made us, and knows our infirmities, and whose tender mercies are over all His
works.</q></note>) which an impertinent officiousness is for glossing with a rubric
and weakening with an apology, proceeded from Divine lips,&mdash;at least
if these concluding verses be genuine. How shall this inconvenient
circumstance be more effectually dealt with than
by accepting the suggestion of the most recent editors, that
S. Mark's concluding verses are an unauthorised addition
to his Gospel? <q>If it be acknowledged that the passage
has a harsh sound,</q> (remarks Dean Stanley,) <q>unlike the
usual utterances of Him who came not to condemn but to
save, the discoveries of later times have shewn, almost beyond
doubt, that it is <emph>not a part of S. Mark's Gospel, but
an addition by another hand</emph>; of which the weakness in the
external evidence coincides with the internal evidence in
proving its later origin.</q><note place="foot"><q>The Athanasian Creed,</q>
by the Dean of Westminster (<hi rend='italic'>Contemporary
Review</hi>, Aug., 1870, pp. 158, 159).</note>
</p>

<p>
Modern prejudice, then,&mdash;added to a singularly exaggerated
estimate of the critical importance of the testimony
<pb n="004"/><anchor id="Pg004"/>
of our two oldest Codices, (another of the <q>discoveries of
later times,</q> concerning which I shall have more to say
by-and-by,)&mdash;must explain why the opinion is even popular
that the last twelve verses of S. Mark are a spurious appendix
to his Gospel.
</p>

<p>
Not that Biblical Critics would have us believe that the
Evangelist left off at verse 8, intending that the words,&mdash;<q>neither
said they anything to any man, for they were
afraid,</q> should be the conclusion of his Gospel. <q>No one
can imagine,</q> (writes Griesbach,) <q>that Mark cut short the
thread of his narrative at that
place.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Commentarius Criticus</hi>, ii. 197.</note>
It is on all hands eagerly admitted, that so abrupt a termination must be held
to mark an incomplete or else an uncompleted work. How,
then, in the original autograph of the Evangelist, is it supposed
that the narrative proceeded? This is what no one
has even ventured so much as to conjecture. It is assumed,
however, that the original termination of the Gospel, whatever
it may have been, has perished. We appeal, of course,
to its actual termination: and,&mdash;Of what nature then, (we
ask,) is the supposed necessity for regarding the last twelve
verses of S. Mark's Gospel as a spurious substitute for what
the Evangelist originally wrote? What, in other words,
has been the history of these modern doubts; and by what
steps have they established themselves in books, and won
the public ear?
</p>

<p>
To explain this, shall be the object of the next ensuing
chapters.

</quote>

<p>
It is only since the appearance of Griesbach's second edition
[1796-1806] that Critics of the New Testament have
permitted themselves to handle the last twelve verses of
S. Mark's Gospel with disrespect. Previous critical editions
of the New Testament are free from this reproach. <q>There
is no reason for doubting the genuineness of this portion of
Scripture,</q> wrote Mill in 1707, after a review of the evidence
(as far as he was acquainted with it) for and against.
Twenty-seven years later, appeared Bengel's edition of the
New Testament (1734); and Wetstein, at the end of another
seventeen years (1751-2), followed in the same field. Both
editors, after rehearsing the adverse testimony <hi rend='italic'>in extenso</hi>,
left the passage in undisputed possession of its place. Alter
in 1786-7, and Birch in 1788,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Quatuor Evangelia

seen in the King's Library (Brit. Mus.)</note> (suspicious as the latter evidently
was of its genuineness,) followed their predecessors'
example. But Matthaei, (who also brought his labours to
a close in the year 1788,) was not content to give a silent
suffrage. He had been for upwards of fourteen years a laborious
collator of Greek MSS. of the New Testament, and
was so convinced of the insufficiency of the arguments which
had been brought against these twelve verses of S. Mark,
<pb n="006"/><anchor id="Pg006"/>
that with no ordinary warmth, no common acuteness, he
insisted on their genuineness.
</p>

<p>
<q>With Griesbach,</q> (remarks Dr.
Tregelles,)<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Account of the Printed Text</hi>, p.
83.</note> <q>Texts which may be called really critical begin;</q> and Griesbach is the
first to insist that the concluding verses of S. Mark are spurious.
That he did not suppose the second Gospel to have always
ended at verse 8, we have seen already.<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg003">3</ref>.</note> He was of opinion,
however, that <q>at some very remote period, the original
ending of the Gospel perished,&mdash;disappeared perhaps <emph>from
the Evangelist's own copy</emph>,&mdash;and that the present ending was
by some one substituted in its place.</q> Griesbach further invented
the following elaborate and extraordinary hypothesis
to account for the existence of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
</p>

<p>
He invites his readers to believe that when, (before the
end of the second century,) the four Evangelical narratives
were collected into a volume and dignified with the title of
<q>The Gospel,</q>&mdash;S. Mark's narrative was furnished by some
unknown individual with its actual termination in order to
remedy its manifest incompleteness; and that this volume
became the standard of the Alexandrine recension of the
text: in other words, became the fontal source of a mighty
family of MSS. by Griesbach designated as <q>Alexandrine.</q>
But there will have been here and there in existence isolated
copies of one or more of the Gospels; and in all of these,
S. Mark's Gospel, (by the hypothesis,) will have ended
abruptly at the eighth verse. These copies of single Gospels,
when collected together, are presumed by Griesbach
to have constituted <q>the Western recension.</q> If, in codices
of this family also, the self-same termination is now all but
universally found, the fact is to be accounted for, (Griesbach
says,) by the natural desire which possessors of the
Gospels will have experienced to supplement their imperfect
copies as best they might. <q>Let this conjecture be accepted,</q>
proceeds the learned veteran,&mdash;(unconscious apparently
that he has been demanding acceptance for at least
half-a-dozen wholly unsupported as well as entirely gratuitous
conjectures,)&mdash;<q>and every difficulty disappears; and
<pb n="007"/><anchor id="Pg007"/>
it becomes perfectly intelligible how there has crept into
almost every codex which has been written, from the second
century downwards, a section quite different from the original
and genuine ending of S. Mark, which disappeared
before the four Gospels were collected into a single volume.</q>&mdash;In
other words, if men will but be so accommodating as
to assume that the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel disappeared
before any one had the opportunity of transcribing
the Evangelist's inspired autograph, they will have no
difficulty in understanding that the present conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel was not really written by S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
It should perhaps be stated in passing, that Griesbach
was driven into this curious maze of unsupported conjecture
by the exigencies of his <q>Recension Theory;</q> which, inasmuch
as it has been long since exploded, need not now occupy
us. But it is worth observing that the argument already
exhibited, (such as it is,) breaks down under the weight of
the very first fact which its learned author is obliged to lay
upon it. Codex B.,&mdash;the solitary manuscript witness for
<emph>omitting</emph> the clause in question, (for Codex א had not yet
been discovered,)&mdash;had been already claimed by Griesbach
as a chief exponent of his so-called <q>Alexandrine Recension.</q>
But then, on the Critic's own hypothesis, (as we have seen
already,) Codex B. ought, on the contrary, to have <emph>contained</emph>
it. How was that inconvenient fact to be got over?
Griesbach quietly remarks in a foot-note that Codex B.
<q><emph>has affinity</emph> with the Eastern family of MSS.</q>&mdash;The misfortune
of being saddled with a worthless theory was surely
never more apparent. By the time we have reached this
point in the investigation, we are reminded of nothing so
much as of the weary traveller who, having patiently pursued
an <hi rend='italic'>ignis fatuus</hi> through half the night, beholds it at
last vanish; but not until it has conducted him up to his
chin in the mire.
</p>

<p>
Neither Hug, nor Scholz his pupil,&mdash;who in 1808 and
1830 respectively followed Griesbach with modifications of
his recension-theory,&mdash;concurred in the unfavourable sentence
which their illustrious predecessor had passed on the
concluding portion of S. Mark's Gospel. The latter even
<pb n="008"/><anchor id="Pg008"/>
eagerly vindicated its genuineness.<note place="foot"><q>Eam esse authenticam
rationes internae et externae probant gravissimae.</q></note>
But with Lachmann,&mdash;whose unsatisfactory text of the Gospels appeared in
1842,&mdash;originated a new principle of Textual Revision;
the principle, namely, of paying exclusive and absolute
deference to the testimony of a few arbitrarily selected
ancient documents; no regard being paid to others of
the same or of yet higher antiquity. This is not the
right place for discussing this plausible and certainly most
convenient scheme of textual revision. That it leads to
conclusions little short of irrational, is certain. I notice it
only because it supplies the clue to the result which, as far
as S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is concerned, has been since arrived
at by Dr. Tischendorf, Dr. Tregelles, and Dean Alford,<note place="foot">I find it
difficult to say what distress the sudden removal of this amiable
and accomplished Scholar occasions me, just as I am finishing my task.

that <emph>he</emph> is no longer among us either to accept or to dispute a single

<p>
They agree in assuring their readers that the genuine
Gospel of S. Mark extends no further than ch. xvi. ver. 8:
in other words, that all that follows the words ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ
is an unauthorized addition by some later hand; <q>a
fragment,</q>&mdash;distinguishable from the rest of the Gospel not
less by internal evidence than by external testimony. This
verdict becomes the more important because it proceeds from
men of undoubted earnestness and high ability; who cannot
be suspected of being either unacquainted with the evidence
on which the point in dispute rests, nor inexperienced in
the art of weighing such evidence. Moreover, their verdict
has been independently reached; is unanimous; is unhesitating;
has been eagerly proclaimed by all three on many
different occasions as well as in many different places;<note place="foot">Tischendorf,
besides eight editions of his laborious critical revision of the

of Codd. א, B and A, set down in English at the foot of every page.&mdash;Tregelles,
besides his edition of the Text of the N. T., is very full on the
subject of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, in his <q>Account of the Printed Text,</q> and in

<q>probably an addition, placed here in very early times.</q></note> and

may be said to be at present in all but undisputed possession
of the field.<note place="foot">The Rev. F. H. Scrivener, Bp. Ellicott, and Bp.

period?;</q>&mdash;both alike resolutely insist on its genuineness and canonicity. To
the honour of the best living master of Textual Criticism, the Rev. F. H. Scrivener, (of
whom I desire to be understood to speak as a disciple of his master,) be it stated that
he has never at any time given the least sanction to the popular outcry against
this portion of the Gospel. <q>Without the slightest misgiving</q> he has uniformly
maintained the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20. (<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
pp. 7 and 429-32.)</note> The first-named Editor enjoys a vast reputation,
and has been generously styled by Mr. Scrivener, <q>the
first Biblical Critic in Europe.</q> The other two have produced
text-books which are deservedly held in high esteem,
and are in the hands of every student. The views of such
men will undoubtedly colour the convictions of the next
generation of English Churchmen. It becomes absolutely
necessary, therefore, to examine with the utmost care the
grounds of their verdict, the direct result of which is to
present us with a mutilated Gospel. If they are right,
there is no help for it but that the convictions of eighteen
centuries in this respect must be surrendered. But if Tischendorf
and Tregelles are wrong in this particular, it follows
of necessity that doubt is thrown over the whole of
their critical method. The case is a crucial one. Every
page of theirs incurs suspicion, if their deliberate verdict
in <emph>this</emph> instance shall prove to be mistaken.
</p>

<p>
1. Tischendorf disposes of the whole question in a single
sentence. <q>That these verses were not written by Mark,</q>
<pb n="010"/><anchor id="Pg010"/>
(he says,) <q>admits of satisfactory proof.</q> He then recites
in detail the adverse external testimony which his predecessors
had accumulated; remarking, that it is abundantly
confirmed by internal evidence. Of this he supplies a solitary
sample; but declares that the whole passage is <q>abhorrent</q>
to S. Mark's manner. <q>The facts of the case being
such,</q> (and with this he dismisses the subject,) <q>a healthy
piety reclaims against the endeavours of those who are for
palming off as Mark's what the Evangelist is so plainly
shewn to have known nothing at all about.</q><note place="foot"><q>Hæc non a Marco
scripta esse argumentis probatur idoneis,</q> (p. 320.) <q>Quæ testimonia aliis
corroborantur argumentis, ut quod conlatis prioribus versu 9. parum apte adduntur
verba αφ᾽ ἧς ἐκβεβ item quod singula multifariam
a Marci ratione abhorrent.</q> (p. 322.)&mdash;I quote from the 7th Leipsic
ed.; but in Tischendorf's 8th ed. (1866, pp. 403, 406,) the same verdict is
repeated, with the following addition:&mdash;<q>Quæ quum ita sint, sanæ erga
sacrum textum pietati adversari videntur qui pro apostolicis venditare pergunt
qua a Marco aliena esse tam luculenter docemur.</q> (p. 407.)</note>
A mass of laborious annotation which comes surging in at the close
of verse 8, and fills two of Tischendorf's pages, has the effect
of entirely divorcing the twelve verses in question from the
inspired text of the Evangelist. On the other hand, the evidence
<emph>in favour</emph> of the place is despatched in less than twelve
lines. What can be the reason that an Editor of the New
Testament parades elaborately every particular of the evidence,
(such as it is,) <emph>against</emph> the genuineness of a considerable
portion of the Gospel; and yet makes summary work
with the evidence in its favour? That Tischendorf has at
least entirely made up his mind on the matter in hand is
plain. Elsewhere, he speaks of the Author of these verses
as <q><hi rend='italic'>Pseudo Marcus</hi>.</q><note place="foot"><hi
rend='italic'>Evangelia Apocrypha</hi>, 1853, Proleg. p. lvi.</note>
</p>

<p>
2. Dr. Tregelles has expressed himself most fully on this
subject in his <q>Account of the Printed Text of the Greek
New Testament</q> (1854). The respected author undertakes
to shew <q>that the early testimony that S. Mark did not
write these verses is confirmed by existing monuments.</q>
Accordingly, he announces as the result of the propositions
which he thinks he has established, <q>that the <emph>book of Mark
himself</emph> extends no further than ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ.</q> He is the
<pb n="011"/><anchor id="Pg011"/>
only critic I have met with to whom it does not seem incredible
that S. Mark did actually conclude his Gospel in
this abrupt way: observing that <q>perhaps we do not know
enough of the circumstances of S. Mark when he wrote his
Gospel to say whether he did or did not leave it with a complete
termination.</q> In this modest suggestion at least Dr.
Tregelles is unassailable, since we know absolutely nothing
whatever about <q>the circumstances of S. Mark,</q> (or of any
other Evangelist,) <q>when he wrote his Gospel:</q> neither
indeed are we quite sure <emph>who</emph> S. Mark <emph>was</emph>. But when he
goes on to declare, notwithstanding, <q>that the remaining
twelve verses, by whomsoever written, have a full claim
to be received as an authentic part of the second Gospel;</q>
and complains that <q>there is in some minds a kind of
timidity with regard to Holy Scripture, as if all our notions
of its authority depended on our knowing who was the
writer of each particular portion; instead of simply seeing
and owning that it was given forth from <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, and that it
is as much His as were the Commandments of the Law
written by His own finger on the tables of stone;</q><note place="foot">Pp. 253,
7-9.</note>&mdash;the learned writer betrays a misapprehension of the question
at issue, which we are least of all prepared to encounter in
such a quarter. We admire his piety but it is at the expense
of his critical sagacity. For the question is not at all
one of <emph>authorship</emph>, but only one of <emph>genuineness</emph>. Have the
codices been <emph>mutilated</emph> which do <emph>not</emph> contain these verses?
If they have, then must these verses be held to be <emph>genuine</emph>.
But on the contrary, Have the codices been <emph>supplemented</emph>
which contain them? Then are these verses certainly <emph>spurious</emph>.
There is no help for it but they must either be held
to be an integral part of the Gospel, and therefore, in default
of any proof to the contrary, as certainly by S. Mark as any
other twelve verses which can be named; or else an unauthorized
addition to it. If they belong to the post-apostolic
age it is idle to insist on their Inspiration, and to
claim that this <q>authentic anonymous addition to what
Mark himself wrote down</q> is as much the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>
<q>as were the Ten Commandments written by His own
<pb n="012"/><anchor id="Pg012"/>
finger on the tables of stone.</q> On the other hand, if they
<q>ought as much to be received as part of our second Gospel
as the last chapter of Deuteronomy (unknown as the writer
is) is received as the right and proper conclusion of the
book of Moses,</q>&mdash;it is difficult to understand why the learned
editor should think himself at liberty to sever them from
their context, and introduce the subscription ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ
after ver. 8. In short, <q>How persons who believe that
these verses did not form a part of the original Gospel of
Mark, but were added afterwards, can say that they have
a good claim to be received as an authentic or genuine part
of the second Gospel, that is, a portion of canonical Scripture,
passes comprehension.</q> It passes even Dr. Davidson's
comprehension; (for the foregoing words are his;) and
Dr. Davidson, as some of us are aware, is not a man to stick
at trifles.<note place="foot">In his first edition (1848, vol. i. p. 163) Dr. Davidson
pronounced it <q>manifestly untenable</q> that S. Mark's Gospel was the last written;
and assigned <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 64 as <q>its most probable</q> date. In his
second (1868, vol. ii. p. 117), he says:&mdash;<q>When we consider that <emph>the Gospel
was not written till the second century</emph>, internal evidence loses much of its force
against the authenticity of these verses.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Introduction to
N.T.</hi></note>
</p>

<p>
3. Dean Alford went a little further than any of his predecessors.
He says that this passage <q>was placed as a completion
of the Gospel soon after the Apostolic period,&mdash;the
Gospel itself having been, for some reason unknown to us,
left incomplete. The most probable supposition</q> (he adds)
<q>is, that <emph>the last leaf of the original Gospel was torn away</emph>.</q>
The italics in this conjecture (which was originally Griesbach's)
are not mine. The internal evidence (declares the
same learned writer) <q>preponderates vastly against the authorship
of Mark;</q> or (as he elsewhere expresses it) against
<q>its genuineness as a work of the Evangelist.</q> Accordingly,
in his Prolegomena, (p. 38) he describes it as <q><emph>the
remarkable fragment</emph> at the end of the Gospel.</q> After this,
we are the less astonished to find that he <emph>closes the second
Gospel at ver.</emph> 8; introduces the Subscription there; and encloses
the twelve verses which follow within heavy brackets.
Thus, whereas from the days of our illustrious countryman
<pb n="013"/><anchor id="Pg013"/>
Mill (1707), the editors of the N. T. have either been silent
on the subject, or else have whispered only that this section
of the Gospel is to be received with less of confidence than
the rest,&mdash;it has been reserved for the present century to
convert the ancient suspicions into actual charges. The
latest to enter the field have been the first to execute Griesbach's
adverse sentence pronounced fifty years ago, and to
load the blessed Evangelist with bonds.
</p>

<p>
It might have been foreseen that when Critics so conspicuous
permit themselves thus to handle the precious
deposit, others would take courage to hurl their thunderbolts
in the same direction with the less concern. <q>It is
probable,</q> (says Abp. Thomson in the <hi rend='italic'>Bible Dictionary</hi>,)
<q>that this section is from a different hand, and was annexed
to the Gospels soon after the times of the Apostles.</q><note place="foot">Vol. ii. p.
239.</note>&mdash;The Rev. T. S. Green,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Developed
Criticism</hi>, [1857], p. 53.</note> (an able scholar, never to be mentioned
without respect,) considers that <q>the hypothesis of very
early interpolation satisfies the body of facts in evidence,</q>&mdash;which
<q>point unmistakably in the direction of a spurious
origin.</q>&mdash;<q>In respect of Mark's Gospel,</q> (writes Professor
Norton in a recent work on the <hi rend='italic'>Genuineness of the Gospels</hi>,)
<q>there is ground for believing that the last twelve verses
were not written by the Evangelist, but were added by some
other writer to supply a short conclusion to the work, which
some cause had prevented the author from completing.</q><note place="foot">Ed. 1847. i.
p. 17. He recommends this view to his reader's acceptance
in five pages,&mdash;pp. 216 to 221.</note>&mdash;Professor
Westcott&mdash;who, jointly with the Rev. F. J. A. Hort,
announces a revised Text&mdash;assures us that <q>the original
text, from whatever cause it may have happened, terminated
abruptly after the account of the Angelic vision.</q> The rest
<q>was added at another time, and probably by another hand.</q>
<q>It is in vain to speculate on the causes of this abrupt
close.</q> <q>The remaining verses cannot be regarded as part
of the original narrative of S. Mark</q><note place="foot">
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction to the Study of the Gospels</hi>, p.
311.</note>&mdash;Meyer insists that this is an <q>apocryphal fragment,</q> and
reproduces all the arguments, external and internal, which have ever been
<pb n="014"/><anchor id="Pg014"/>
arrayed against it, without a particle of misgiving. The
<q>note</q> with which he takes leave of the subject is even
insolent.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Critical and Exegetical Commentary</hi>,
1855, 8vo. pp. 182, 186-92.</note> A comparison (he says) of these <q>fragments</q>
(ver. 9-18 and 19) with the parallel places in the other
Gospels and in the Acts, shews how vacillating and various
were the Apostolical traditions concerning the appearances
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> after His Resurrection, and concerning His
Ascension. (<q>Hast thou killed, and also taken possession?</q>)
</p>

<p>
Such, then, is the hostile verdict concerning these last
twelve verses which I venture to dispute, and which I trust
I shall live to see reversed. The writers above cited will be
found to rely (1.) on the external evidence of certain ancient
MSS.; and (2.) on Scholia which state <q>that the more
ancient and accurate copies terminated the Gospel at ver. 8.</q>
(3.) They assure us that this is confirmed by a formidable
array of Patristic authorities. (4.) Internal proof is declared
not to be wanting. Certain incoherences and inaccuracies
are pointed out. In fine, <q>the phraseology and style of
the section</q> are declared to be <q>unfavourable to its authenticity;</q>
not a few of the words and expressions being
<q>foreign to the diction of Mark.</q>&mdash;I propose to shew that
all these confident and imposing statements are to a great
extent either mistakes or exaggerations, and that the slender
residuum of fact is about as powerless to achieve the purpose
of the critics as were the seven green withs of the Philistines
to bind Samson.
</p>

<p>
In order to exhibit successfully what I have to offer on
this subject, I find it necessary to begin (in the next chapter)
at the very beginning. I think it right, however, in this
place to premise a few plain considerations which will be of
use to us throughout all our subsequent inquiry; and which
indeed we shall never be able to afford to lose sight of
for long.
</p>

<p>
The question at issue being simply this,&mdash;Whether it is
reasonable to suspect that the last twelve verses of S. Mark
are a spurious accretion and unauthorized supplement to his
Gospel, or not?&mdash;the whole of our business clearly resolves
itself into an examination of what has been urged in proof
<pb n="015"/><anchor id="Pg015"/>
that the former alternative is the correct one. Our opponents
maintain that these verses did not form part of the
original autograph of the Evangelist. But it is a known
rule in the Law of Evidence that <emph>the burthen of proof lies on
the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue</emph>.<note place="foot">In the Roman
law this principle is thus expressed,&mdash;<q>Ei incumbit probatio
qui dicit, non qui negat.</q> Taylor <hi rend='italic'>on the Law of Evidence</hi>,
1868, i. p. 369.</note> We have
therefore to ascertain in the present instance what the supposed
proof is exactly worth; remembering always that in
this subject-matter a <emph>high degree of probability</emph> is the only
kind of proof which is attainable. When, for example, it is
contended that the famous words in S. John's first Epistle
(1 S. John v. 7, 8,) are not to be regarded as genuine, the
fact that they are away from almost every known Codex
is accepted as a proof that they were also away from the
autograph of the Evangelist. On far less weighty evidence,
in fact, we are at all times prepared to yield the hearty
assent of our understanding in this department of sacred
science.
</p>

<p>
And yet, it will be found that evidence of overwhelming
weight, if not of an entirely different kind, is required in
the present instance: as I proceed to explain.
</p>

<p>
1. When it is contended that our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s reply to the
young ruler (S. Matt. xix. 17) <emph>was not</emph> Τί με λέγεις ἀγαθόν;
οὐδεὶς ἀγαθὸς, εἰ μὴ εῖς, ὁ Θεός,&mdash;it is at the same time insisted
that <emph>it was</emph> Τί με ἐρωτᾷς περὶ τοῦ ἀγαθοῦ; εῖς ἐστὶν
ὁ ἀγαθός. It is proposed to omit the former words <emph>only</emph> because
an alternative clause is at hand, which it is proposed
to substitute in its room.
</p>

<p>
2. Again. When it is claimed that some given passage
of the Textus Receptus,&mdash;S. Mark ch xv. 28, for example,
(καὶ ἐπληρώθη ἡ γραφὴ ἡ λέγουσα, Καὶ μετὰ ἀνόμων ἐλογίσθη,)
or the Doxology in S. Matth. vi. 13,&mdash;is spurious,
all that is pretended is that certain words are an unauthorized
addition to the inspired text; and that by simply
omitting them we are so far restoring the Gospel to its
original integrity.&mdash;The same is to be said concerning <emph>every
other charge of interpolation which can be named</emph>. If the
celebrated <q>pericopa de adulterâ,</q> for instance, be indeed
<pb n="016"/><anchor id="Pg016"/>
not genuine, we have but to leave out those twelve verses
of S. John's Gospel, and to read chap. vii. 52 in close sequence
with chap. viii. 12; and we are assured that we are put in
possession of the text as it came from the hands of its inspired
Author. Nor, (it must be admitted), is any difficulty
whatever occasioned thereby; for there is no reason assignable
why the two last-named verses should <emph>not</emph> cohere; (there
is no internal improbability, I mean, in the supposition;)
neither does there exist any <hi rend='italic'>à priori</hi> reason why a considerable
portion of narrative should be looked for in that particular
part of the Gospel.
</p>

<p>
3. But the case is altogether different, as all must see,
when it is proposed to get rid of the twelve verses which
for 1700 years and upwards have formed the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel; no alternative conclusion being proposed
to our acceptance. For let it be only observed what this
proposal practically amounts to and means.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a.</hi>) And first, it does <emph>not</emph> mean that S. Mark
himself, with design, brought his Gospel to a close at the words ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ.
<emph>That</emph> supposition would in fact be irrational. It does
not mean, I say, that by simply leaving out those last
twelve verses we shall be restoring the second Gospel to its
original integrity. And this it is which makes the present
a different case from every other, and necessitates a fuller,
if not a different kind of proof.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b.</hi>) What then? It means that although an abrupt and
impossible termination would confessedly be the result of
omitting verses 9-20, no nearer approximation to the original
autograph of the Evangelist is at present attainable.
Whether S. Mark was <emph>interrupted</emph> before he could finish his
Gospel,&mdash;(as Dr. Tregelles and Professor Norton suggest;)&mdash;in
which case it will have been published by its Author
in an unfinished state: or whether <q><emph>the last leaf was torn
away</emph></q> before a single copy of the original could be procured,&mdash;(a
view which is found to have recommended itself
to Griesbach;)&mdash;in which case it will have once had a different
termination from at present; which termination however,
by the hypothesis, has since been irrecoverably lost;&mdash;(and
to one of these two wild hypotheses the critics are
<pb n="017"/><anchor id="Pg017"/>
logically reduced;)&mdash;<emph>this</emph> we are not certainly told. The
critics are only agreed in assuming that S. Mark's Gospel
<emph>was at first without the verses which at present conclude it</emph>.
</p>

<p>
But this assumption, (that a work which has been held
to be a complete work for seventeen centuries and upwards
was originally incomplete,) of course requires <emph>proof</emph>. The
foregoing improbable theories, based on a gratuitous assumption,
are confronted <hi rend='italic'>in limine</hi> with a formidable obstacle
which must be absolutely got rid of before they can be
thought entitled to a serious hearing. It is a familiar and
a fatal circumstance that the Gospel of S. Mark has been
furnished with its present termination ever since the second
century of the Christian æra.<note place="foot">This is freely allowed by all.
<q>Certiores facti sumus hanc pericopam jam
in secundo sæculo lectam fuisse tanquam hujus evangelii partem.</q> Tregelles
<hi rend='italic'>N.T.</hi> p. 214.</note> In default, therefore, of distinct
historical evidence or definite documentary proof that
<emph>at some earlier period than that</emph> it terminated abruptly, nothing
short of the utter unfitness of the verses which at present
conclude S. Mark's Gospel to be regarded as the work
of the Evangelist, would warrant us in assuming that they
are the spurious accretion of the post-apostolic age: and as
such, at the end of eighteen centuries, to be deliberately
rejected. We must absolutely be furnished, I say, with internal
evidence of the most unequivocal character; or else
with external testimony of a direct and definite kind, if we
are to admit that the actual conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel
is an unauthorized substitute for something quite different
that has been lost. I can only imagine one other thing
which could induce us to entertain such an opinion; and
that would be the <emph>general</emph> consent of MSS., Fathers, and
Versions in leaving these verses out. Else, it is evident
that we are logically <emph>forced</emph> to adopt the far easier supposition
that (<emph>not</emph> S. Mark, but) <emph>some copyist of the third century</emph>
left a copy of S. Mark's Gospel unfinished; which unfinished
copy became the fontal source of the mutilated copies which
have come down to our own times.<note place="foot">This in fact is how Bengel (N. T. p.
626) accounts for the phenomenon:&mdash;<q>Fieri potuit ut librarius, scripto versu 8,
reliquam partem scribere differret, et id exemplar, casu non perfectum, alii quasi
perfectum sequerentur, praesertim quum ea pars cum reliquâ historiâ evangelicâ
minus congruere videretur.</q></note>
</p>

<pb n="018"/><anchor id="Pg018"/>

<p>
I have thought it right to explain the matter thus fully
at the outset; not in order to prejudge the question, (for
<emph>that</emph> could answer no good purpose,) but only in order that
the reader may have clearly set before him the real nature
of the issue. <q>Is it reasonable to suspect that the concluding
verses of S. Mark are a spurious accretion and unauthorized
supplement to his Gospel, or not?</q> <emph>That</emph> is the question
which we have to consider,&mdash;the <emph>one</emph> question. And
while I proceed to pass under careful review all the evidence
on this subject with which I am acquainted, I shall be again
and again obliged to direct the attention of my reader to its
bearing on the real point at issue. In other words, we shall
have again and again to ask ourselves, how far it is rendered
probable by each fresh article of evidence that S. Mark's
Gospel, when it left the hands of its inspired Author, was an
unfinished work; the last chapter ending abruptly at ver. 8?
</p>

<p>
I will only point out, before passing on, that the course
which has been adopted towards S. Mark xvi. 9-20, by the
latest Editors of the New Testament, is simply illogical.
Either they regard these verses as <emph>possibly</emph> genuine, or else
as <emph>certainly</emph> spurious. If they entertain (as they say they
do) a decided opinion that they are <emph>not</emph> genuine, they ought
(if they would be consistent) <emph>to banish them from the text</emph>.<note
place="foot">It is thus that Tischendorf treats S. Luke xxiv. 12, and (in his latest
edition) S. John xxi. 25.</note> Conversely, <emph>since they do not banish them from the
text</emph>, they have no right to pass a fatal sentence upon them; to designate
their author as <q>pseudo-Marcus;</q> to handle them in
contemptuous fashion. The plain truth is, these learned men
are better than their theory; the worthlessness of which they
are made to <emph>feel</emph> in the present most conspicuous instance.
It reduces them to perplexity. It has landed them in inconsistency
and error.&mdash;They will find it necessary in the
end to reverse their convictions. They cannot too speedily
reconsider their verdict, and retrace their steps.

The present inquiry must be conducted solely on grounds
of Evidence, external and internal. For the full consideration
of the former, seven Chapters will be necessary:<note place="foot">Chap. III.-VIII.,
also Chap. X.</note> for a discussion of the latter, one seventh of that space will
suffice.<note place="foot">Chap. IX.</note> We have first to ascertain whether the
external testimony concerning S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is of such a nature
as to constrain us to admit that it is highly probable that
those twelve verses are a spurious appendix to S. Mark's
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
1. It is well known that for determining the Text of the
New Testament, we are dependent on three chief sources of
information: viz. (1.) on <hi rend="smallcaps">Manuscripts</hi>,&mdash;(2.) on
<hi rend="smallcaps">Versions</hi>,&mdash;(3.) on <hi rend="smallcaps">Fathers</hi>.
And it is even self-evident that the <emph>most ancient</emph> MSS.,&mdash;the
<emph>earliest</emph> Versions,&mdash;the <emph>oldest</emph> of the Fathers,
will probably be in every instance the most trustworthy
witnesses.
</p>

<p>
2. Further, it is obvious that a really ancient Codex of
the Gospels must needs supply more valuable critical help
in establishing the precise Text of Scripture than can possibly
be rendered by any Translation, however faithful:
while Patristic citations are on the whole a less decisive
authority, even than Versions. The reasons are chiefly
these:&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>a.</hi>) Fathers often quote Scripture loosely, if not
licentiously; and sometimes <emph>allude</emph> only when they seem to
<emph>quote</emph>. (<hi rend='italic'>b.</hi>) They appear to have too often depended
on their memory, and sometimes are demonstrably loose and inaccurate
<pb n="020"/><anchor id="Pg020"/>
in their citations; the same Father being observed
to quote the same place in different ways. (<hi rend='italic'>c.</hi>) Copyists and
Editors may not be altogether depended upon for the exact
form of such supposed quotations. Thus the evidence of
Fathers must always be to some extent precarious.
</p>

<p>
3. On the other hand, it cannot be too plainly pointed
out that when,&mdash;instead of certifying ourselves of the <emph>actual
words employed</emph> by an Evangelist, their precise <emph>form</emph> and
exact <emph>sequence</emph>,&mdash;our object is only to ascertain whether
a considerable passage of Scripture is genuine or not; is to
be rejected or retained; was known or was not known in the
earliest ages of the Church; then, instead of supplying the
least important evidence, Fathers become by far the most
valuable witnesses of all. This entire subject may be conveniently
illustrated by an appeal to the problem before us.
</p>

<p>
4. Of course, if we possessed copies of the Gospels coeval
with their authors, nothing could compete with such evidence.
But then unhappily nothing of the kind is the case.
The facts admit of being stated within the compass of a few
lines. We have one Codex (the Vatican, B) which is thought
to belong to the first half of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century;
and another, the newly discovered Codex Sinaiticus, (at St. Petersburg, א)
which is certainly not quite so old,&mdash;perhaps by 50 years.
Next come two famous codices; the Alexandrine (in the
British Museum, A) and the Codex Ephraemi (in the Paris
Library, C), which are probably from 50 to 100 years more
recent still. The Codex Bezae (at Cambridge, D) is considered
by competent judges to be the depository of a recension
of the text as ancient as any of the others. Notwithstanding
its strangely depraved condition therefore,&mdash;the
many <q>monstra potius quam variae lectiones</q> which it
contains,&mdash;it may be reckoned with the preceding four,
though it must be 50 or 100 years later than the latest of
them. After this, we drop down, (as far as S. Mark is concerned,)
to 2 uncial MSS. of the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,&mdash;7 of
the ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,&mdash;4 of the
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> or
x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,<note place="foot">Viz. E, L, [viii]: K, M, V,
Γ, Δ, Λ (quære), Π (Tisch. <hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 8va.) [ix]:
G, X, S, U [ix, x]. The following uncials are defective here,&mdash;F (ver. 9-19),
H (ver. 9-14), I, N, O, P, Q, R, T, W, Y, Z.</note>
while cursives of the xi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
and xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
<pb n="021"/><anchor id="Pg021"/>
centuries are very numerous indeed,&mdash;the copies increasing
in number in a rapid ratio as we descend the stream of Time.
Our primitive manuscript witnesses, therefore, are but <emph>five</emph>
in number at the utmost. And of these it has never been
pretended that the oldest is to be referred to an earlier date
than the beginning of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
while it is thought by competent judges that the last named may very possibly
have been written quite late in the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>.
</p>

<p>
5. Are we then reduced to this fourfold, (or at most fivefold,)
evidence concerning the text of the Gospels,&mdash;on evidence
of not quite certain date, and yet (as we all believe) not
reaching further back than to the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century of our æra? Certainly not. Here, <hi rend="smallcaps">Fathers</hi> come to our
aid. There are perhaps as many as an hundred Ecclesiastical Writers older
than the oldest extant Codex of the N. T.: while between
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 300 and <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 600, (within which
limits our five oldest MSS. may be considered certainly to fall,) there exist about
two hundred Fathers more. True, that many of these have
left wondrous little behind them; and that the quotations
from Holy Scripture of the greater part may justly be described
as rare and unsatisfactory. But what then? From
the three hundred, make a liberal reduction; and an hundred
writers will remain who <emph>frequently</emph> quote the New
Testament, and who, when they do quote it, are probably
as trustworthy witnesses to the Truth of Scripture as either
Cod. א or Cod. B. We have indeed heard a great deal too
much of the precariousness of this class of evidence: not
nearly enough of the gross inaccuracies which disfigure the
text of those two Codices. Quite surprising is it to discover
to what an extent Patristic quotations from the New Testament
have evidently retained their exact original form.
What we chiefly desiderate at this time is a more careful
revision of the text of the Fathers, and more skilfully
elaborated indices of the works of each: <emph>not one</emph> of them
having been hitherto satisfactorily indexed. It would be
easy to demonstrate the importance of bestowing far more
attention on this subject than it seems to have hitherto
enjoyed: but I shall content myself with citing a single
instance; and for this, (in order not to distract the reader's
<pb n="022"/><anchor id="Pg022"/>
attention), I shall refer him to the Appendix.<note place="foot">See
<ref target="Appendix_A">Appendix (A)</ref>, on the true reading of S. Luke ii.
14.</note> What is at least beyond the limits of controversy, whenever <emph>the
genuineness of a considerable passage of Scripture</emph> is the point in dispute,
the testimony of Fathers who undoubtedly recognise
that passage, is beyond comparison the most valuable testimony
we can enjoy.
</p>

<p>
6. For let it be only considered what is implied by
a Patristic appeal to the Gospel. It amounts to this:&mdash;that
a conspicuous personage, probably a Bishop of the
Church,&mdash;one, therefore, whose history, date, place, are all
more or less matter of notoriety,&mdash;gives us his written assurance
that the passage in question was found in that copy of
the Gospels which he was accustomed himself to employ;
<emph>the uncial codex</emph>, (it has long since perished) <emph>which belonged to
himself</emph> or to the Church which he served. It is evident, in
short, that any objection to quotations from Scripture in the
writings of the ancient Fathers can only apply to the form
of those quotations; not to their <emph>substance</emph>. It is just as
certain that a verse of Scripture was actually read by the
Father who unmistakedly refers to it, as if we had read it
with him; even though the gravest doubts may be entertained
as to the <q>ipsissima verba</q> which were found in his
own particular copy. He may have trusted to his memory:
or copyists may have taken liberties with his writings: or
editors may have misrepresented what they found in the
written copies. The <emph>form</emph> of the quoted verse, I repeat, may
have suffered almost to any extent. The <emph>substance</emph>, on the
contrary, inasmuch as it lay wholly beyond their province,
may be looked upon as an indisputable <emph>fact</emph>.
</p>

<p>
7. Some such preliminary remarks, (never out of place
when quotations from the Fathers are to be considered,)
cannot well be withheld when the most venerable Ecclesiastical
writings are appealed to. The earliest of the Fathers
are observed to quote with singular licence,&mdash;to <emph>allude</emph> rather
than to quote. Strange to relate, those ancient men seem
scarcely to have been aware of the grave responsibility they
incurred when they substituted expressions of their own for
the utterances of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Spirit</hi>. It is evidently not so much
<pb n="023"/><anchor id="Pg023"/>
that their <emph>memory</emph> is in fault, as their <emph>judgment</emph>,&mdash;in that
they evidently hold themselves at liberty to paraphrase, to
recast, to reconstruct.<note place="foot">Consider how Ignatius (<hi rend='italic'>ad
Smyrn.</hi>, c. 3) quotes S. Luke xxiv. 39; and how he refers to S. John xii. 3 in his
Ep. <hi rend='italic'>ad Ephes.</hi> c. 17.</note>
</p>

<p>
I. Thus, it is impossible to resist the inference that <hi rend="smallcaps">Papias</hi>
refers to S. Mark xvi. 18 when he records a marvellous
tradition concerning <q>Justus surnamed Barsabas,</q> <q>how
that after drinking noxious poison, through the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s grace
he experienced no evil consequence.</q><note place="foot">Ἱστορεῖ [sc. Παπίας]
ἕτερον παράδοξον περὶ Ἰοῦστον τὸν ἐπικληθέντα Βαρσαβᾶν γεγονὸς,&mdash;evidently a slip of
the pen for Βαρσαβᾶν τὸν ἐπικληθέντα Ἰοῦστον (see Acts i. 23, quoted by Eusebius
immediately afterwards,)&mdash;ὡς δηλητήριον φάρμακον ἐμπιόντος καὶ μηδὲν ἀηδὲς διὰ
τὴν τοῦ Κυρίου χάριν ὑπομείναντος. Euseb. <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Eccl.</hi> iii.
39.</note> He does not give <emph>the words</emph> of the Evangelist. It is even
surprising how completely he passes them by; and yet the allusion to the place
just cited is manifest. Now, Papias is a writer who lived so
near the time of the Apostles that he made it his delight
to collect their traditional sayings. His date (according to
Clinton) is <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 100.
</p>

<p>
II. <hi rend="smallcaps">Justin Martyr</hi>, the date of whose first Apology is
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 151, is observed to say concerning the Apostles that,
after our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s Ascension,&mdash;ἐξελθόντες πανταχοῦ
ἐκήρυξαν:<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Apol.</hi> I. c. 45.&mdash;The supposed
quotations in c. 9 from the Fragment <hi rend='italic'>De Resurrectione</hi> (Westcott
and others) are clearly references to S. Luke xxiv.,&mdash;<emph>not</emph>
to S. Mark xvi.</note> which is nothing else but a quotation from the last
verse of S. Mark's Gospel,&mdash;ἐκεῖνοι δὲ ἐξελθόντες ἐκήρυξαν πανταχοῦ.
And thus it is found that the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel was familiarly known within fifty years
of the death of the last of the Evangelists.
</p>

<p>
III. When <hi rend="smallcaps">Irenæus</hi>, in his third Book against Heresies,
deliberately quotes and remarks upon the 19th verse of the
last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel,<note place="foot">lib. iii. c. x. <hi rend='italic'>ad
fin.</hi> (ed. Stieren, i. p. 462). <q>In fine autem Evangelii ait
Marcus, <emph>et quidem Dominus Jesus, postquam locutus est sis, receptus est in
caelos, et sedet ad dexteram Dei.</emph></q> Accordingly, against S. Mark xvi. 19 in
Harl. MS. 5647 ( = Evan. 72) occurs the following marginal scholium, which
Cramer has already published:&mdash;Εἰρηναῖος ὁ τῶν Ἀποστόλων πλησίον, ἐν τῷ
πρὸς τὰς αἱρέσεις γ᾽ λόγῳ τοῦτο ἀνήνεγκεν τὸ ῥητον ὡς Μάρκῳ ειρημένον.</note>
we are put in possession of
<pb n="024"/><anchor id="Pg024"/>
the certain fact that the entire passage now under consideration
was extant in a copy of the Gospels which was
used by the Bishop of the Church of Lyons sometime about
the year <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 180, and which therefore cannot possibly have
been written much more than a hundred years after the
date of the Evangelist himself: while it <emph>may</emph> have been
written by a contemporary of S. Mark, and probably <emph>was</emph>
written by one who lived immediately after his time.&mdash;Who
sees not that this single piece of evidence is in itself sufficient
to outweigh the testimony of any codex extant? It is
in fact a mere trifling with words to distinguish between
<q>Manuscript</q> and <q>Patristic</q> testimony in a case like
this: for (as I have already explained) the passage quoted
from S. Mark's Gospel by Irenæus is to all intents and purposes
<emph>a fragment from a dated manuscript</emph>; and <emph>that</emph> MS.,
demonstrably older by at least one hundred and fifty years
than the oldest copy of the Gospels which has come down
to our times.
</p>

<p>
IV. Take another proof that these concluding verses of
S. Mark were in the second century accounted an integral
part of his Gospel. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hippolytus</hi>, Bishop of Portus near
Borne (190-227), a contemporary of Irenæus, quotes the
17th and 18th verses in his fragment Περὶ Χαρισμάτων.<note place="foot"><p>First
published as his by Fabricius (vol. i. 245.) Its authorship has never
been disputed. In the enumeration of the works of Hippolytus (inscribed on the
chair of his marble effigy in the Lateran Museum at Rome) is read,&mdash;ΠΕΡΙ
ΧΑΡΙΣΜΑΤΩΝ; and by that name the fragment in question is actually designated
in the third chapter of the (so called) <q>Apostolical Constitutions,</q>
(τὰ μὲν σῦν πρῶτα τοῦ λόγου ἐξεθέμεθα περὶ τῶν Χαρισμάτων, κ.τ.λ.),&mdash;in
which singular monument of Antiquity the fragment itself is also found. It
is in fact nothing else but the first two chapters of the <q>Apostolical
Constitutions;</q> of which the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter is
also claimed for Hippolytus, (though with evidently far less reason,) and as such
appears in the last edition of the Father's collected works, (<hi rend='italic'>Hippolyti
Romani quæ feruntur omnia Græce</hi>, ed. Lagarde, 1858,)&mdash;p. 74.
</p>
<p>
The work thus assigned to Hippolytus, (evidently on the strength of the
heading,&mdash;Διατάξεις τῶν ἀυτῶν ἁγίων Ἀποστόλων περὶ χειροτονιῶν, διὰ Ἱππολύτου,)
is part of the <q>Octateuchus Clementinus,</q> concerning which Lagarde
has several remarks in the preface to his <hi rend='italic'>Reliquiæ Juris Ecclesiastici
Antiquissimæ</hi>, 1856. The composition in question extends from p. 5 to p. 18 of the
last-named publication. The exact correspondence between the <q>Octateuchus
Clementinus</q> and the Pseudo-Apostolical Constitutions will be found to extend
no further than the single chapter (the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>)
specified in the text. In the meantime the fragment περὶ χαρισμάτων (containing S.
Mark xvi. 17, 18,) is identical throughout. It forms the first article in Lagarde's
<hi rend='italic'>Reliquiæ</hi>, extending from p. 1 to p. 4, and is there headed
Διδασκαλία τῶν ἁγίων Ἁποστόλων περὶ χαρισμάτων.</p></note>
<pb n="025"/><anchor id="Pg025"/>
Also in his Homily on the heresy of Noetus,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ad
fin.</hi> See Routh's <hi rend='italic'>Opuscula</hi>, i. p. 80.</note>
Hippolytus has a plain reference to this section of S. Mark's Gospel.
To an inattentive reader, the passage alluded to might seem
to be only the fragment of a Creed; but this is not the
case. In the Creeds, <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi> is <emph>invariably</emph> spoken
of as ανελθόντα: in the Scriptures, <emph>invariably</emph> as ἀναληθέντα.<note
place="foot">For which reason I cordially subscribe to Tischendorf's remark (ed. 8va.
p. 407), <q>Quod idem [Justinus] Christum ἀνεληλυθόντα εἰς τοὺς οὐράνους dicit,
[<hi rend='italic'>Apol.</hi> I. c. 50?] minus valet.</q></note>
So that when Hippolytus says of Him, ἀναλαμβάνεται εἰς
οὐρανοὺς καὶ ἐκ δεξιῶν Πατρὸς καθίζεται, the reference must
needs be to S. Mark xvi. 19.
</p>

<p>
V. At the Seventh <hi rend="smallcaps">Council of Carthage</hi> held under
Cyprian, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 256, (on the baptizing of Heretics,) Vincentius,
Bishop of Thibari, (a place not far from Carthage,) in
the presence of the eighty-seven assembled African bishops,
quoted two of the verses under consideration;<note place="foot"><q>In nomine meo manum
imponite, daemonia expellite,</q> (Cyprian Opp. p. 237 [<hi rend='italic'>Reliqq.

VI. The Apocryphal <hi rend="smallcaps">Acta Pilati</hi> (sometimes called the

to the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century; whether rightly or wrongly
I have no means of ascertaining. It is at all events a very
ancient forgery, and it contains the 15th, 16th, 17th and
18th verses of this chapter.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Evangelia

<p>
VIII and IX. It will be shewn in <ref target="Chapter_V">Chapter V.</ref>
that <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>,
the Ecclesiastical Historian, was profoundly well acquainted
with these verses. He discusses them largely, and
(as I shall prove in the chapter referred to) was by no means
disposed to question their genuineness. His Church History
was published <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 325.
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Marinus</hi> also, (whoever that individual may have been,)
a contemporary of Eusebius,&mdash;inasmuch as he is introduced
to our notice by Eusebius himself as asking a question concerning
the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel without
a trace of misgiving as to the genuineness of that about
which he inquires,&mdash;is a competent witness in their favor
who has hitherto been overlooked in this discussion.
</p>

<p>
X. Tischendorf and his followers state that Jacobus Nisibenus
quotes these verses. For <q>Jacobus Nisibenus</q> read
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Aphraates</hi> the Persian Sage,</q> and the statement will be
correct. The history of the mistake is curious.
</p>

<p>
Jerome, in his Catalogue of Ecclesiastical writers, makes
no mention of Jacob of Nisibis,&mdash;a famous Syrian Bishop
who was present at the Council of Nicæa, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 325. Gennadius
of Marseille, (who carried on Jerome's list to the
year 495) asserts that the reason of this omission was Jerome's
ignorance of the Syriac language; and explains that
Jacob was the author of twenty-two Syriac Homilies.<note place="foot"><hi

which was accordingly edited as the work of Jacobus Nisibenus
with a Latin version, at Rome, in 1756. Gallandius
reprinted both the Armenian and the Latin; and to Gallandius
(vol. v.) we are referred whenever <q>Jacobus Nisibenus</q>
is quoted.

But the proposed attribution of the Homilies in question,&mdash;though
it has been acquiesced in for nearly 1400 years,&mdash;is
incorrect. Quite lately the Syriac originals have come to
light, and they prove to be the work of Aphraates, <q>the
Persian Sage,</q>&mdash;a Bishop, and the earliest known Father of
the Syrian Church. In the first Homily, (which bears date
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 337), verses 16, 17, 18 of S. Mark xvi. are
quoted,<note place="foot">See Dr. Wright's ed. of <q>Aphraates,</q>
(4<hi rend="vertical-align: super">to</hi>. 1869.) i. p. 21. I am entirely

nor yet from the Peshito exactly.<note place="foot">From Dr. Wright, and my brother

(<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 374-397) freely

once.<note place="foot">Vol. i. 796 E and vol. ii. 461 D quote ver. 15: 1429 B

<p>
XII. The testimony of <hi rend="smallcaps">Chrysostom</hi>
(<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 400) has been
all but overlooked. In part of a Homily claimed for him
by his Benedictine Editors, he points out that S. Luke
alone of the Evangelists describes the Ascension: S. Matthew
and S. John not speaking of it,&mdash;S. Mark recording
the event only. Then he quotes verses 19, 20. <q>This</q>
(he adds) <q>is the end of the Gospel. Mark makes no extended
mention of the Ascension.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii.
765 A, B.</note> Elsewhere he has an
unmistakable reference to S. Mark xvi. 9.<note place="foot">Καὶ μὴν τὸ ἐυαγγέλιον
τοὐναντίον λέγει, ὅτι τῇ Μαρία πρώτῃ [ὤφθη].
Chrys. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ch. 355 B.</note>
</p>

<p>
XIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome</hi>, on a point like this, is entitled to more
attention than any other Father of the Church. Living
at a very early period, (for he was born in 331 and died in
420,)&mdash;endowed with extraordinary Biblical learning,&mdash;a
man of excellent judgment,&mdash;and a professed Editor of
<pb n="028"/><anchor id="Pg028"/>
the New Testament, for the execution of which task he
enjoyed extraordinary facilities,&mdash;his testimony is most
weighty. Not unaware am I that Jerome is commonly
supposed to be a witness on the opposite side: concerning
which mistake I shall have to speak largely in <ref target="Chapter_V">Chapter V</ref>.
But it ought to be enough to point out that we should not
have met with these last twelve verses in the Vulgate, had
Jerome held them to be spurious.<note place="foot"><q>Cogis</q> (he says to Pope
Damasus) <q>ut post exemplaria Scripturarum toto orbe dispersa quasi quidam arbiter
sedeam; et quia inter se variant, quae sint illa quae cum Graecâ consentiant veritate
decernam.&mdash;Haec praesens praefatiuncula pollicetur quatuor Evangelia ... codicum
Graecorum emendata conlatione, sed et veterum.</q></note>  He familiarly quotes
the 9th verse in one place of his writings;<note place="foot">Vol. i. p. 327 C
(<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> Vallars.)</note> in another place
he makes the extraordinary statement that in certain of the
copies, (especially the Greek,) was found after ver. 14 <emph>the
reply of the eleven Apostles</emph>, when our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>
<q>upbraided them with their unbelief and hardness of heart, because
they believed not them which had seen Him after He was
risen.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Contra Pelagianos</hi>, II. 15, (Opp. ii.
744-5):&mdash;<q>In quibusdam exemplaribus et maxima in Graecis codicibus, juxta Marcum

apparuit eis Jesus, et exprobravit incredulitatem et duritiam cordis eorum, quia his
qui viderant eum resurgentem, non crediderunt. Et illi satisfaciebant dicentes: Sæculum
istud iniquitatis et incredulitatis substantia est, quae non sinit per immundos spiritus
veram Dei apprehendi virtutem: idcirco jam nunc revela justitiam tuam.</hi></q></note>
To discuss so weak and worthless a forgery,&mdash;no
trace of which is found in any MS. in existence, and of
which nothing whatever is known except what Jerome here
tells us,&mdash;would be to waste our time indeed. The fact remains,
however, that Jerome, besides giving these last twelve
verses a place in the Vulgate, quotes S. Mark xvi. 14, as
well as ver. 9, in the course of his writings.
</p>

<p>
XIV. It was to have been expected that <hi rend="smallcaps">Augustine</hi> would
quote these verses: but he more than quotes them. He
brings them forward again and again,<note place="foot">E.g. ver. 12 in vol. ii. 515 C
(Ep. 149); Vol. v. 988 C.&mdash;Verses 15, 16, in vol. v. 391 E, 985 A: vol. x. 22
F.</note>&mdash;discusses them as
the work of S. Mark,&mdash;remarks that <q>in diebus Paschalibus,</q>
S. Mark's narrative of the Resurrection was publicly
<pb n="029"/><anchor id="Pg029"/>
read in the Church.<note place="foot">Vol. v. 997 F, 998 B, C.</note>
All this is noteworthy. Augustine
flourished <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 395-430.
</p>

<p>
XV. and XVI. Another very important testimony to the
genuineness of the concluding part of S. Mark's Gospel is
furnished by the unhesitating manner in which <hi rend="smallcaps">Nestorius</hi>,
the heresiarch, quotes ver. 20; and <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyril</hi> of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Alexandria</hi> accepts his quotation, adding a few words of his
own.<note place="foot">ἐξελθόντες γάρ, φησι, διεκήρυσσον τὸν λόγον πανταχοῦ.
τοῦ Κυρίοῦ συνεργοῦντος, καὶ τὸν λόγον βεβαιοῦντος, διὰ τῶν ἐπακολουθησάντων σημειων.
Nestorius <hi rend='italic'>c. Orthodoxos</hi>: (Cyril. Alexand. <hi rend='italic'>adv.
Nestorian.</hi> Opp. vol. vi. 46 B.) To which, Cyril replies,&mdash;τῇ παρ᾽ αὐτοῦ
δυναστείᾳ χρώμενοι, διεκηρύσσοντο καὶ εἰργάζοντο τὰς θεοσημείας οἱ θεοπέσιοι
μαθηταὶ. (<hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> D.) This quotation was
first noticed by Matthaei (<hi rend='italic'>Enthym. Zig.</hi> i. 161.)</note> Let
it be borne in mind that this is tantamount to the discovery
of <emph>two</emph> dated codices containing the last twelve verses of
S. Mark,&mdash;and <emph>that</emph> date <emph>anterior</emph> (it is impossible to
say by how many years) to <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 430.
</p>

<p>
XVII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch</hi>, (concerning whom I shall
have to speak very largely in <ref target="Chapter_V">Chapter V</ref>.,) flourished
about <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 425. The critical testimony which he bears to the
genuineness of these verses is more emphatic than is to be
met with in the pages of any other ancient Father. It may
be characterized as the most conclusive testimony which it
was in his power to render.
</p>

<p>
XVIII. <hi rend="smallcaps">Hesychius</hi> of Jerusalem, by a singular oversight,
has been reckoned among the impugners of these verses.
He is on the contrary their eager advocate and champion.
It seems to have escaped observation that towards the close
of his <q>Homily on the Resurrection,</q> (published in the
works of Gregory of Nyssa, and erroneously ascribed to
that Father,) Hesychius appeals to the 19th verse, and quotes
it as S. Mark's at length.<note place="foot">ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὸ παρὰ τῷ Μάρκῳ
γεγραμμένον; Ὁ μὲν οὄν Κύριος&mdash;ἐκ δεξιῶν τοῦ Θεοῦ. Greg. Nyss.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 415.</note>
The date of Hesychius is uncertain;
but he may, I suppose, be considered to belong to
the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century. His evidence is discussed
in <ref target="Chapter_V">Chapter V</ref>.
</p>

<p>
XIX. This list shall be brought to a close with a reference
to the <hi rend="smallcaps">Synopsis Scripturae Sacrae</hi>,&mdash;an ancient work
<pb n="030"/><anchor id="Pg030"/>
ascribed to Athanasius,<note place="foot">Athanasii <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. ii.
p. 181 F, 182 A. See the <hi rend='italic'>Præfat.</hi>, pp. vii., viii.</note>
but probably not the production of
that Father. It is at all events of much older date than
any of the later uncials; and it rehearses in detail the contents
of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.<note place="foot"><p>In dismissing this enumeration, let me be
allowed to point out that there must exist many more Patristic citations which I have
overlooked. The necessity one is under, on occasions like the present, of depending to a
great extent on <q>Indices,</q> is fatal; so scandalously inaccurate is almost every
Index of Texts that can be named. To judge from the Index in Oehler's edition of
Tertullian, that Father quotes these twelve verses not less than eight times.
According to the Benedictine Index, Ambrose does not quote them so much
as once. Ambrose, nevertheless, quotes five of these verses no less than fourteen
times; while Tertullian, as far as I am able to discover, does not quote
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 at all.
</p>
<p>
Again. One hoped that the Index of Texts in Dindorf's new Oxford ed. of
Clemens Alex. was going to remedy the sadly defective Index in Potter's ed.
But we are still exactly where we were. S. John i. 3 (or 4), so remarkably
quoted in vol. iii. 433, l. 8: S. John i. 18, 50, memorably represented in vol. iii.
412, l. 26: S. Mark i. 13, interestingly referred to in vol. iii. 455, lines 5, 6,
7:&mdash;are nowhere noticed in the Index. The Voice from Heaven at our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Baptism,&mdash;a famous misquotation (vol. i. 145, l.
14),&mdash;does not appear in the Index of quotations from S. Matthew (iii. 17), S.
Mark (i. 11), or S. Luke (iii. 22.)]
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
It would be easy to prolong this enumeration of Patristic
authorities; as, by appealing to Gregentius in the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, and to Gregory the Great, and
Modestus, patriarch of Constantinople
in the vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>;&mdash;to Ven. Bede and John Damascene
in the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>;&mdash;to Theophylact in the
xi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>;&mdash;to Euthymius in the
xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi><note place="foot">Gregentius
<hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Galland. xi. 653 E.&mdash;Greg. Mag. (Hom. xxix. in
Evang.)&mdash;Modestus <hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Photium cod. 275.&mdash;Johannis
Damasceni <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> (ed. 1712) vol. i. 608 E.&mdash;Bede, and
Theophylact (who quotes <emph>all</emph> the verses) and Euthymius <hi rend='italic'>in
loc.</hi></note>: but I forbear. It would add no strength to my
argument that I should by such evidence support it; as the
reader will admit when he has read my X<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter.
</p>

<p>
It will be observed then that <emph>three</emph> competent Patristic
witnesses of the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>
century,&mdash;<emph>four</emph> of the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi>,&mdash;<emph>six</emph> of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,&mdash;<emph>four</emph> of the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,&mdash;and <emph>two</emph> (of uncertain date,
but probably) of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,&mdash;have admitted
their familiarity with these <q>last Twelve Verses.</q> Yet do they not belong to one
particular age, school, or country. They come, on the contrary,
from every part of the ancient Church: Antioch and
<pb n="031"/><anchor id="Pg031"/>
Constantinople,&mdash;Hierapolis, Cæsarea and Edessa,&mdash;Carthage,
Alexandria and Hippo,&mdash;Rome and Portus. And thus, upwards
of nineteen early codexes have been to all intents and
purposes inspected for us in various lands by unprejudiced
witnesses,&mdash;<emph>seven</emph> of them at least of more ancient date than
the oldest copy of the Gospels extant.
</p>

<p>
I propose to recur to this subject for an instant when the
reader has been made acquainted with the decisive testimony
which ancient Versions supply. But the Versions deserve
a short Chapter to themselves.

</quote>

<p>
It was declared at the outset that when we are seeking to
establish in detail <emph>the Text</emph> of the Gospels, the testimony
of Manuscripts is incomparably the most important of all.
To early Versions, the second place was assigned. To Patristic
citations, the third. But it was explained that whenever
(as here) the only question to be decided is whether
a considerable portion of Scripture be genuine or not, then,
Patristic references yield to no class of evidence in importance.
To which statement it must now be added that second
only to the testimony of Fathers on such occasions is to be
reckoned the evidence of the oldest of the Versions. The
reason is obvious, (<hi rend='italic'>a.</hi>) We know for the most part the approximate
date of the principal ancient Versions of the New
Testament:&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>b.</hi>) Each Version is represented by at least one
very ancient Codex:&mdash;and (<hi rend='italic'>c.</hi>) It may be safely assumed that
Translators were never dependant on a single copy of the
original Greek when they executed their several Translations.
Proceed we now to ascertain what evidence the oldest
of the Versions bear concerning the concluding verses of
S. Mark's Gospel: and first of all for the Syriac.
</p>

<p>
I. <q>Literary history,</q> (says Mr. Scrivener,) <q>can hardly
afford a more powerful case than has been established for
the identity of the Version of the Syriac now called the
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Peshito</hi></q> with that used by the Eastern Church long before
the great schism had its beginning, in the native land
<pb n="033"/><anchor id="Pg033"/>
of the blessed Gospel.</q> The Peshito is referred by common
consent to the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> century of our æra; and is
found to contain the verses in question.
</p>

<p>
II. This, however, is not all. Within the last thirty years,
fragments of <emph>another</emph> very ancient Syriac translation of the
Gospels, (called from the name of its discoverer <q><hi rend="smallcaps">The Curetonian
Syriac</hi>,</q>) have come to light:<note place="foot">Dr. Wright informs me (1871) that
some more leaves of this Version have just been recovered.</note> and in this translation
also the verses in question are found.<note place="foot">By a happy providence, one of
the fragments contains the last four verses.</note> This fragmentary
codex is referred by Cureton to the middle of the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century. At what earlier date the Translation
may have been executed,&mdash;as well as how much older the original Greek
copy may have been which this translator employed,&mdash;can
of course only be conjectured. But it is clear that we are
listening to another truly primitive witness to the genuineness
of the text now under consideration;&mdash;a witness (like
the last) vastly more ancient than either the Vatican
Codex B, or the Sinaitic Codex א; more ancient, therefore,
than any Greek copy of the Gospels in existence. We shall
not be thought rash if we claim it for the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi>
century.
</p>

<p>
III. Even this, however, does not fully represent the sum
of the testimony which the Syriac language bears on this
subject. Philoxenus, Monophysite Bishop of Mabug (Hierapolis)
in Eastern Syria, caused a revision of the Peshito
Syriac to be executed by his Chorepiscopus Polycarp, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
508; and by the aid of three<note place="foot">In the margin, against S. Matth. xxviii.
5, Thomas writes,&mdash;<q><emph>In tribus codicibus Græcis</emph>, et in uno Syriaco
antiquæ versionis, non inventum est nomen, <q>Nazarenus.</q></q>&mdash;Cf. ad xxvii.
35.&mdash;Adler's <hi rend='italic'>N. T. Verss. Syrr.</hi>, p. 97.</note>
approved and accurate Greek manuscripts, this revised version of Polycarp was again
revised by Thomas of Hharkel, in the monastery of Antonia
at Alexandria, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 616. The Hharklensian Revision, (commonly
called the <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Philoxenian</hi>,</q>) is therefore an extraordinary
monument of ecclesiastical antiquity indeed: for,
being the Revision of a revised Translation of the New
Testament known to have been executed from MSS. which
must have been at least as old as the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
it exhibits
<pb n="034"/><anchor id="Pg034"/>
the result of what may be called a collation of copies
made at a time when only four of our extant uncials were
in existence. Here, then, is a singularly important accumulation
of manuscript evidence on the subject of the verses
which of late years it has become the fashion to treat as
spurious. And yet, neither by Polycarp nor by Thomas
of Hharkel, are the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel
omitted.<note place="foot">That among the 437 various readings and marginal notes on the
Gospels relegated to the Philoxenian margin, should occur the worthless supplement
which is only found besides in Cod. L. (see ch.
<ref target="Chapter_VIII">viii</ref>.)&mdash;is not at all surprising.
Of these 437 readings and notes, 91 are not found in White's Edition; while
105 (the supplement in question being one of them) are found in White only.
This creates a suspicion that in part at least the Philoxenian margin must
exhibit traces of the assiduity of subsequent critics of the Syriac text. (So
Adler on S. Matth. xxvi. 40.) To understand the character of some of those
marginal notes and annotations, the reader has but to refer to Adler's learned
work, (pp. 79-134) and examine the notes on the following places:&mdash;S. Matth.
xv. 21: xx. 28 ( = D): xxvi. 7. S. Mk. i. 16: xii. 42. S. Lu. x. 17 ( = B D):
42 ( = B א L): xi. 1: 53. S. Jo. ii. 1 [3] ( = א): iii. 26: vii. 39 (partly
 = B): x. 8, &amp;c. &amp;c.</note>
</p>

<p>
To these, if I do not add the <q>Jerusalem version,</q>&mdash;(as
an independent Syriac translation of the Ecclesiastical Sections,
perhaps of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, is
called,<note place="foot">This work has at last been published in 2 vols. 4to., Verona,
1861-4, under the following title:&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Evangeliarium Hierosolymitanum
ex Codice Vaticano Palaestino demprompsit, edidit, Latine vertit, Prolegomenis et
Glossario adornavit, Comes</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">Franciscus Miniscalchi
Erizzo</hi>.</note>)&mdash;it is because our fourfold Syriac evidence is already
abundantly sufficient. In itself, it far outweighs in respect of antiquity anything
that can be shewn on the other side. Turn we next to the
Churches of the West.
</p>

<p>
IV. That Jerome, at the bidding of Pope Damasus (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
382), was the author of that famous Latin version of the
Scriptures called <hi rend="smallcaps">The Vulgate</hi>, is known to all. It seems
scarcely possible to overestimate the critical importance of
such a work,&mdash;executed at such a time,&mdash;under such auspices,&mdash;and
by a man of so much learning and sagacity as Jerome.
When it is considered that we are here presented with the
results of a careful examination of the best Greek Manuscripts
to which a competent scholar had access in the
middle of the fourth century,&mdash;(and Jerome assures us that
<pb n="035"/><anchor id="Pg035"/>
he consulted several,)&mdash;we learn to survey with diminished
complacency our own slender stores (if indeed any at all
exist) of corresponding antiquity. It is needless to add
that the Vulgate contains the disputed verses: that from
no copy of this Version are they away. Now, in such
a matter as this, Jerome's testimony is very weighty indeed.
</p>

<p>
V. The Vulgate, however, was but the revision of a much
older translation, generally known as the <hi rend="smallcaps">Vetus Itala</hi>.
This Old Latin, which is of African origin and of almost
Apostolic antiquity, (supposed of the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>
century,) conspires with the Vulgate in the testimony which it bears to the
genuineness of the end of S. Mark's Gospel:<note place="foot">It does not sensibly
detract from the value of this evidence that one ancient codex, the <q>Codex
Bobbiensis</q> (k), which Tregelles describes as <q>a revised text, in which the
influence of ancient MSS. is discernible,</q> [<hi rend='italic'>Printed text</hi>, &amp;c.
p. 170.] and which therefore may
not be cited in the present controversy,&mdash;exhibits after ver. 8 a Latin translation
of the spurious words which are also found in Cod. L.</note>&mdash;an emphatic
witness that in the African province, from the earliest time,
no doubt whatever was entertained concerning the genuineness
of these last twelve verses.
</p>

<p>
VI. The next place may well be given to the venerable
version of the Gothic Bishop Ulphilas,&mdash;<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 350. Himself
a Cappadocian, Ulphilas probably derived his copies from
Asia Minor. His version is said to have been exposed to
certain corrupting influences; but the unequivocal evidence
which it bears to the last verses of S. Mark is at least unimpeachable,
and must be regarded as important in the
highest degree.<note place="foot"><q>Quod Gothicum testimonium haud scio an critici
satis agnoverint, vel pro dignitate aestimaverint.</q> Mai, <hi rend='italic'>Nova Patt.
Bibl.</hi> iv. 256.</note> The oldest extant copy of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Gothic</hi>
of Ulphilas is assigned to the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> or early in the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century: and the verses in question are there
also met with.
</p>

<p>
VII. and VIII. The ancient Egyptian versions call next
for notice: their testimony being so exceedingly ancient
and respectable. The <hi rend="smallcaps">Memphitic</hi>, or dialect of Lower
Egypt, (less properly called the <q>Coptic</q> version), which
is assigned to the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> or
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, contains S. Mark xvi.
9-20.&mdash;Fragments of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Thebaic</hi>, or dialect of Upper
Egypt, (a distinct version and of considerably earlier date,
<pb n="036"/><anchor id="Pg036"/>
less properly called the <q>Sahidic,</q>) survive in MSS. of
very nearly the same antiquity: and one of these fragments
happily contains the last verse of the Gospel according
to S. Mark. The Thebaic version is referred to the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century.
</p>

<p>
After this mass of evidence, it will be enough to record
concerning the Armenian version, that it yields inconstant
testimony: some of the MSS. ending at ver. 8; others
putting after these words the subscription, (ἐυαγγέλιον κατὰ
Μαρκον,) and then giving the additional verses with a new
subscription: others going on without any break to the
end. This version may be as old as the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century;
but like the Ethiopic [iv-vii?] and the Georgian [vi?] it
comes to us in codices of comparatively recent date. All
this makes it impossible for us to care much for its testimony.
The two last-named versions, whatever their disadvantages
may be, at least bear constant witness to the
genuineness of the verses in dispute.
</p>

<p>
1. And thus we are presented with a mass of additional
evidence,&mdash;so various, so weighty, so multitudinous, so
venerable,&mdash;in support of this disputed portion of the Gospel,
that it might well be deemed in itself decisive.
</p>

<p>
2. For these Versions do not so much shew what individuals
held, as what Churches have believed and taught
concerning the sacred Text,&mdash;mighty Churches in Syria
and Mesopotamia, in Africa and Italy, in Palestine and
Egypt.
</p>

<p>
3. We may here, in fact, conveniently review the progress
which has been hitherto made in this investigation. And
in order to bar the door against dispute and cavil, let us
be content to waive the testimony of Papias as precarious,
and that of Justin Martyr as too fragmentary to be decisive.
Let us frankly admit that the citation of Vincentius à
Thibari at the vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Carthaginian Council is
sufficiently inexact to make it unsafe to build upon it. The <q>Acta Pilati</q>
and the <q>Apostolical Constitutions,</q> since their date
is somewhat doubtful, shall be claimed for the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century only, and not for the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi>. And now,
how will the evidence stand for the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?
</p>

<pb n="037"/><anchor id="Pg037"/>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) In the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, to
which Codex A and Codex C are referred, (for Codex D is certainly later,) at least three
famous Greeks and the most illustrious of the Latin Fathers,&mdash;(<emph>four</emph>
authorities in all,)&mdash;are observed to recognise these
verses.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) In the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
(to which Codex B and Codex א probably belong, five Greek writers, one Syriac, and two
Latin Fathers,&mdash;besides the Vulgate, Gothic and Memphitic
Versions,&mdash;(<emph>eleven</emph> authorities in all,)&mdash;testify to familiar
acquaintance with this portion of S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) In the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century,
(and by this time MS. evidence has entirely forsaken us,) we find Hippolytus, the
Curetonian Syriac, and the Thebaic Version, bearing plain testimony
that at that early period, in at least <emph>three</emph> distinct provinces
of primitive Christendom, no suspicion whatever attached
to these verses. Lastly,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>d</hi>) In the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> century,
Irenæus, the Peshito, and the Italic Version as plainly attest that in Gaul, in
Mesopotamia and in the African province, the same verses
were unhesitatingly received within a century (more or
less) of the date of the inspired autograph of the Evangelist
himself.
</p>

<p>
4. Thus, we are in possession of the testimony of <emph>at least
six</emph> independent witnesses, of a date considerably anterior to
the earliest extant Codex of the Gospels. They are all of
the best class. They deliver themselves in the most unequivocal
way. And their testimony to the genuineness of
these Verses is unfaltering.
</p>

<p>
5. It is clear that nothing short of direct adverse evidence
of the weightiest kind can sensibly affect so formidable an
array of independent authorities as this. What must the
evidence be which shall set it entirely aside, and induce us
to believe, with the most recent editors of the inspired Text,
that the last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel, as it came from
the hands of its inspired author, ended abruptly at ver. 8?
</p>

<p>
The grounds for assuming that his <q>last Twelve Verses</q>
are spurious, shall be exhibited in the ensuing chapter.

It would naturally follow to shew that manuscript evidence
confirms the evidence of the ancient Fathers and of
the early Versions of Scripture. But it will be more satisfactory
that I should proceed to examine without more
delay the testimony, which, (as it is alleged,) is borne by
a cloud of ancient Fathers against the last twelve verses of
S. Mark. <q>The absence of this portion from some, from
many, or from most copies of his Gospel, or that it was not
written by S. Mark himself,</q> (says Dr. Tregelles,) <q>is attested
by Eusebius, Gregory of Nyssa, Victor of Antioch,
Severus of Antioch, Jerome, and by later writers, especially
Greeks.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Account of the Printed Text</hi>, p.
247.</note> The same Fathers are appealed to by Dr. Davidson,
who adds to the list Euthymius; and by Tischendorf and
Alford, who add the name of Hesychius of Jerusalem. They
also refer to <q>many ancient Scholia.</q> <q>These verses</q>
(says Tischendorf) <q>are not recognised by the sections of
Ammonius nor by the Canons of Eusebius: Epiphanius and
Cæsarius bear witness to the fact.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Gr. Test.</hi>
p. 322.</note> <q>In the Catenæ on Mark</q> (proceeds Davidson) <q>the section is not
explained. Nor is there any trace of acquaintance with it on the part of
Clement of Rome or Clement of Alexandria;</q>&mdash;a remark
which others have made also; as if it were a surprising circumstance
that Clement of Alexandria, who appears to have
no reference to the last chapter of <hi rend='italic'>S. Matthew's</hi> Gospel, should
<pb n="039"/><anchor id="Pg039"/>
be also without any reference to the last chapter of <hi rend='italic'>S. Mark's</hi>:
as if, too, it were an extraordinary thing that Clement of
Rome should have omitted to quote from the last chapter of
S. Mark,&mdash;seeing that the same Clement does not quote
from S. Mark's Gospel <emph>at all</emph>.... The alacrity displayed by
learned writers in accumulating hostile evidence, is certainly
worthy of a better cause. Strange, that their united industry
should have been attended with such very unequal success
when their object was to exhibit the evidence <emph>in favour of</emph>
the present portion of Scripture.
</p>

<p>
(1) Eusebius then, and (2) Jerome; (3) Gregory of Nyssa
and (4) Hesychius of Jerusalem; (5) Severus of Antioch,
(6) Victor of Antioch, and (7) Euthymius:&mdash;Do the accomplished
critics just quoted,&mdash;Doctors Tischendorf, Tregelles,
and Davidson, really mean to tell us that <q>it is attested</q> by
these seven Fathers that the concluding section of S. Mark's
Gospel <q>was not written by S. Mark himself?</q> Why, there
is <emph>not one</emph> of them who says so: while some of them say the
direct reverse. But let us go on. It is, I suppose, because
there are Twelve Verses to be demolished that the list is
further eked out with the names of (8) Ammonius, (9) Epiphanius,
and (10) Cæsarius,&mdash;to say nothing of (11) the
anonymous authors of Catenæ, and (12) <q>later writers, especially
Greeks.</q>
</p>

<p>
I. I shall examine these witnesses one by one: but it will
be convenient in the first instance to call attention to the
evidence borne by,
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory of Nyssa.</hi>
</p>

<p>
This illustrious Father is represented as expressing himself
as follows in his second <q>Homily on the Resurrection;</q><note place="foot">Ἐν μὲν
τοῖς ἀκριβεστέροις ἀντιγράφοις τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον εὺαγγέλιον μέχρι

the more accurate copies, the Gospel according to Mark
has its end at <q>for they were afraid.</q> In some copies, however,
this also is added,&mdash;<q>Now when He was risen early the

out of whom He had cast seven devils.</q></q>
</p>

<pb n="040"/><anchor id="Pg040"/>

<p>
That this testimony should have been so often appealed
to as proceeding from Gregory of Nyssa,<note place="foot">Tregelles,
<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 248, also in Horne's
<hi rend='italic'>Introd.</hi> iv. 434-6. So Norton, Alford, Davidson, and the
rest, following Wetstein, Griesbach, Scholz, &amp;c.</note> is little to the
credit of modern scholarship. One would have supposed
that the gravity of the subject,&mdash;the importance of the issue,&mdash;the
sacredness of Scripture, down to its minutest jot and
tittle,&mdash;would have ensured extraordinary caution, and induced
every fresh assailant of so considerable a portion of
the Gospel to be very sure of his ground before reiterating
what his predecessors had delivered. And yet it is evident
that not one of the recent writers on the subject can have
investigated this matter for himself. It is only due to their
known ability to presume that had they taken ever so little
pains with the foregoing quotation, they would have found
out their mistake.
</p>

<p>
(1.) For, in the first place, the second <q>Homily on the
Resurrection</q> printed in the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> volume of
the works of Gregory of Nyssa, (and which supplies the critics with
their quotation,) is, as every one may see who will take the
trouble to compare them, <emph>word for word the same Homily</emph>
which Combefis in his <q>Novum Auctarium,</q> and Gallandius
in his <q>Bibliotheca Patrum</q> printed as the work of Hesychius,
and vindicated to that Father, respectively in 1648
and 1776.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Nov. Auct.</hi> i.
743-74.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Bibl. Vett. PP.</hi> xi. 221-6.</note>
Now, if a critic chooses to risk his own reputation
by maintaining that the Homily in question is indeed
by Gregory of Nyssa, and is not by Hesychius,&mdash;well and
good. But since the Homily can have had but one author,
it is surely high time that one of these two claimants should
be altogether dropped from this discussion.
</p>

<p>
(2.) Again. Inasmuch as page after page of the same
Homily is observed to reappear, <emph>word for word</emph>, under the
name of <q>Severus of Antioch,</q> and to be unsuspiciously
printed as his by Montfaucon in his <q>Bibliotheca Coisliniana</q>
(1715), and by Cramer in his <q>Catena</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Bibl.
Coisl.</hi> pp. 68-75.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Catena</hi>, i. 243-51.</note>
(1844),&mdash;although
it may very reasonably become a question among
critics whether Hesychius of Jerusalem or Severus of Antioch
<pb n="041"/><anchor id="Pg041"/>
was the actual author of the Homily in question,<note place="foot">Dionysius Syrus (i.e.
the Monophysite Jacobus Bar-Salibi [see Dean Payne Smith's <hi rend='italic'>Cat. of
Syrr. MSS.</hi> p. 411] who died <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 1171) in his
<hi rend='italic'>Exposition of S. Mark's Gospel</hi> (published at Dublin by Dudley
Loftus, 1672, 4to.) seems (at p. 59) to give this homily to Severus.&mdash;I have really
no independent opinion on the subject.</note> yet
it is plain that critics must make their election between the
two names; and not bring them <emph>both</emph> forward. No one,
I say, has any right to go on quoting <q>Severus</q> <emph>and</emph>
<q>Hesychius,</q>&mdash;as Tischendorf and Dr. Davidson are observed to
do:&mdash;<q>Gregory of Nyssa</q> <emph>and</emph> <q>Severus of Antioch,</q>&mdash;as
Dr. Tregelles is found to prefer.
</p>

<p>
(3.) In short, here are three claimants for the authorship
of one and the same Homily. To whichever of the three
we assign it,&mdash;(and competent judges have declared that
there are sufficient reasons for giving it to Hesychius rather
than to Severus,&mdash;while <emph>no one</emph> is found to suppose that
Gregory of Nyssa was its author,)&mdash;<emph>who</emph> will not admit that
no further mention must be made of the other two?
</p>

<p>
(4.) Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that henceforth
the name of <q>Gregory of Nyssa</q> must be banished from
this discussion. So must the name of <q>Severus of Antioch.</q>
The memorable passage which begins,&mdash;<q>In the more accurate
copies, the Gospel according to Mark has its end
at <q>for they were afraid,</q></q>&mdash;is found in <emph>a Homily which
was probably written by Hesychius, presbyter of Jerusalem,&mdash;a
writer of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century</emph>. I shall have
to recur to his work by-and-by. The next name is
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>,
</p>

<p>
II. With respect to whom the case is altogether different.
What that learned Father has delivered concerning
the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel requires to be examined
with attention, and must be set forth much more in detail.
And yet, I will so far anticipate what is about to be offered,
as to say at once that if any one supposes that Eusebius has
anywhere plainly <q>stated that it is <emph>wanted in many
MSS.</emph>,</q><note place="foot">Alford, <hi rend='italic'>Greek Test.</hi> i. p.
433.</note>&mdash;he is mistaken. Eusebius nowhere says so. The reader's
attention is invited to a plain tale.
</p>

<p>
It was not until 1825 that the world was presented by
<pb n="042"/><anchor id="Pg042"/>
Cardinal Angelo Mai<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Scriptorum Vett. Nova
Collectio</hi>, 4to. vol. i. pp. 1-101.</note> with a few fragmentary specimens
of a lost work of Eusebius on the (so-called) Inconsistencies
in the Gospels, from a MS. in the Vatican.<note place="foot">At p. 217,
(<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1847), Mai designates it as <q>Codex Vat. Palat. cxx
pulcherrimus, sæculi ferme x.</q> At p. 268, he numbers it rightly,&mdash;ccxx. We
are there informed that the work of Eusebius extends from fol. 61 to 96 of
the Codex.</note> These, the
learned Cardinal republished more accurately in 1847, in
his <q>Nova Patrum Bibliotheca;</q><note place="foot">Vol. iv. pp. 219-309.</note>
and hither we are invariably
referred by those who cite Eusebius as a witness
against the genuineness of the concluding verses of the
second Gospel.
</p>

<p>
It is much to be regretted that we are still as little as
ever in possession of the lost work of Eusebius. It appears
to have consisted of three Books or Parts; the former two
(addressed <q>to Stephanus</q>) being discussions of difficulties
at the beginning of the Gospel,&mdash;the last (<q>to Marinus</q>)
relating to difficulties in its concluding chapters.<note place="foot">See
<hi rend='italic'>Nova P. P. Bibliotheca</hi>, iv. 255.&mdash;That it was styled
<q>Inquiries with their Resolutions</q> (Ζητήματα καὶ Λύσεις), Eusebius leads us to
suppose by himself twice referring to it under that name, (<hi rend='italic'>Demonstr.
Evang. lib.</hi> vii. 3: also in the Preface to Marinus, <hi rend='italic'>Mai</hi>, iv.
255:) which his abbreviator is also observed to employ (<hi rend='italic'>Mai</hi>, iv.
219, 255.) But I suspect that he and others so designate the work only from the nature
of its contents; and that its actual title is correctly indicated by
Jerome,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>De Evangeliorum Diaphoniâ</hi>: <q>Edidit</q> (he says)
<q>de Evangeliorum Diaphoniâ,</q> (<hi rend='italic'>De Scriptt. Illustt.</hi> c. 81.)
Again, Διαφωνία Εὐαγγελίων, (<hi rend='italic'>Hieron.</hi> in Matth. i. 16.) Consider
also the testimony of Latinus Latinius, given below, p. <ref target="Pg044">44</ref>,
note (q). <q>Indicated</q> by Jerome, I say: for the entire title was probably,
Περὶ τῆς δοκούσης ἐν τοῖς εὐαγγελίοις κ.τ.λ. διαφωνίας. The Author of the Catena on S.
Mark edited by Cramer (i. p. 266), quotes an opinion of Eusebius ἐν τῷ πρὸς Μαρῖνον περὶ
τῆς δοκούσης ἐν εὐαγγελίοις περὶ τῆς ἀναστάσεως διαφωνίας: words which are
extracted from the same MS. by Simon, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Crit. N. T.</hi> p.
89.</note> The Author's plan, (as usual in such works), was, first, to set
forth a difficulty in the form of a Question; and straightway,
to propose a Solution of it,&mdash;which commonly assumes
the form of a considerable dissertation. But whether we are
at present in possession of so much as a single entire specimen
of these <q>Inquiries and Resolutions</q> exactly as it came
from the pen of Eusebius, may reasonably be doubted. That
<pb n="043"/><anchor id="Pg043"/>
the work which Mai has brought to light is but a highly
condensed exhibition of the original, (and scarcely that,) its
very title shews; for it is headed,&mdash;<q>An abridged selection
from the <q>Inquiries and Resolutions [of difficulties] in the
Gospels</q> by Eusebius.</q><note place="foot">Ἐκλογὴ ἐν συντόμῳ ἐκ τῶν συντεθέντων ὑπὸ
Εὐσεβίου πρὸς Στέφανον [and πρὸς Μαρῖνον] περὶ τῶν ἐν τοῖς Εὐαγγελίοις ζητημάτων καὶ
λύσεων. <hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> pp. 219, 255.&mdash;(See the plate of fac-similes
facing the title of vol. i. ed. 1825.)</note>
Only <emph>some</emph> of the original Questions,
therefore, are here noticed at all: and even these have
been subjected to so severe a process of condensation and
abridgment, that in some instances <emph>amputation</emph> would probably
be a more fitting description of what has taken place.
Accordingly, what were originally two Books or Parts, are
at present represented by XVI. <q>Inquiries,</q> &amp;c, addressed
<q>to Stephanus;</q> while the concluding Book or Part is represented
by IV. more, <q>to Marinus,</q>&mdash;of which, <emph>the first</emph>
relates to our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> appearing to Mary Magdalene after
His Resurrection. Now, since the work which Eusebius addressed
to Marinus is found to have contained <q>Inquiries,
with their Resolutions, concerning our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi>
<hi rend='italic'>Death</hi> and Resurrection,</q><note place="foot">Σὐσέβιος ...

known Catena of Cramer, (ii. 389,) where it is assigned to Severus of Antioch:
but it occurs also in <hi rend='italic'>Corderii Cat. in Joan.</hi> p. 436. (See Mai, iv.
299.)</note>&mdash;while a quotation professing to be derived
from <q>the <emph>thirteenth</emph> chapter</q> relates to Simon the
Cyrenian bearing our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Cross;<note place="foot">This
passage is too grand to be withheld:&mdash;Οὐ γὰρ ἤν ἀξιός τις ἐν τῇ πόλει

343.)</note>&mdash;it is obvious that the original work must have been very considerable,
and that what Mai has recovered gives an utterly inadequate
idea of its extent and importance.<note place="foot">Mai, iv. p. 299.&mdash;The Catenæ,
inasmuch as their compilers are observed to have been very curious in such questions,
are evidently full of <hi rend='italic'>disjecta membra</hi> of the work. These are
recognisable for the most part by their form; but sometimes they actually retain the name
of their author. Accordingly, Catenæ have furnished Mai with a considerable body of
additional materials; which (as far as a MS. Catena of Nicetas on S. Luke, [Cod. A.
<hi rend='italic'>seu</hi> Vat. 1611,] enabled him,) he has edited with considerable
industry; throwing them into a kind of Supplement. (Vol. iv. pp. 268-282, and pp.
283-298.) It is only surprising that with the stores at his command, Mai has not
contrived to enlighten us a little more on this curious subject. It would not be
difficult to indicate sundry passages which he has overlooked. Neither indeed can it be
denied that the learned Cardinal has executed his task in a somewhat slovenly manner.
He does not seem to have noticed that what he quotes at pp.
357-8&mdash;262&mdash;283&mdash;295, is to be found in the <hi rend='italic'>Catena</hi>
of <hi rend='italic'>Corderius</hi> at pp. 448-9&mdash;449&mdash;450&mdash;457.&mdash;He
quotes (p. 300) from an unedited Homily of John Xiphilinus, (<hi rend='italic'>Cod.
Vat.</hi> p. 160,) what he might have found in Possinus; and in Cramer too, (p. 446.)
He was evidently unacquainted with Cramer's work, though it had been published
3 (if not 7) years before his own,&mdash;else, at p. 299, instead of quoting
Simon, he would have quoted Cramer's <hi rend='italic'>Catenæ</hi>, i. 266.&mdash;It was
in his power to solve his own shrewd doubt, (at p. 299,&mdash;concerning the text of a
passage in Possinus, p. 343,) seeing that the Catena which Possinus published was
transcribed by Corderius from a MS. in the Vatican. (Possini
<hi rend='italic'>Præfat.</hi> p. ii.) In the Vatican, too, he might have found
the fragment he quotes (p. 300) from p. 364 of the <hi rend='italic'>Catena</hi>
of Possinus. In countless places he might, by
such references, have improved his often manifestly faulty text.</note>
It is absolutely necessary
<pb n="044"/><anchor id="Pg044"/>
that all this should be clearly apprehended by any one
who desires to know exactly what the alleged evidence of
Eusebius concerning the last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel is
worth,&mdash;as I will explain more fully by-and-by. Let it,
however, be candidly admitted that there seems to be no
reason for supposing that whenever the lost work of Eusebius
comes to light, (and it has been seen within about
300 years<note place="foot"><p>Mai quotes the following from Latinus Latinius

one <q>Marinus,</q> who is represented as asking, first, the following
question:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>How is it, that, according to Matthew [xxviii. 1], the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> appears to have risen <q>in the end of the Sabbath;</q>

Τὴν τοῦτο φάσκουσαν περικοπήν is probably a gloss, explanatory of τὸ κεφάλαιον
αὐτό. In strictness, the κεφάλαιον begins at ch. xv. 42, and extends to the end
of the Gospel. There are 48 such κεφάλαια in S. Mark. But this term was
often loosely employed by the Greek Fathers, (as <q>capitulum</q> by the Latins,)
to denote <emph>a passage</emph> of Scripture, and it is evidently so used here.
Περικοπή, on the contrary, in this place seems to have its true technical meaning, and to
denote the liturgical <emph>section</emph>, or <q>lesson.</q></note> will say that it is
not met with in <emph>all</emph> the copies of Mark's Gospel: the accurate copies,
at all events, making the end of Mark's narrative come after
the words of the young man who appeared to the women
and said, <q>Fear not ye! Ye seek <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi> of Nazareth,</q> &amp;c.:
to which the Evangelist adds,&mdash;<q>And when they heard it,
they fled, and said nothing to any man, for they were
afraid.</q> For at those words, in almost all copies of the
Gospel according to Mark, comes the end. What follows,
(which is met with seldom, [and only] in some copies, certainly
not in all,) might be dispensed with; especially if it
should prove to contradict the record of the other Evangelists.
This, then, is what a person will say who is for
evading and entirely getting rid of a gratuitous problem.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But another, on no account daring to reject anything
whatever which is, under whatever circumstances, met with
in the text of the Gospels, will say that here are two readings,
(as is so often the case elsewhere;) and that <emph>both</emph> are to
be received,&mdash;inasmuch as by the faithful and pious, <emph>this</emph>
reading is not held to be genuine rather than <emph>that</emph>; nor <emph>that</emph>
than <emph>this</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
It will be best to exhibit the whole of what Eusebius has
written on this subject,&mdash;as far as we are permitted to know
it,&mdash;continuously. He proceeds:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>Well then, allowing this piece to be really genuine, our
business is to interpret the sense of the passage.<note place="foot">Ἀνάγνωσμα

here used in its technical sense, and to designate the liturgical <emph>section</emph>,

if I divide the meaning into two, we shall find that
it is not opposed to what Matthew says of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>'s
having risen <q>in the end of the Sabbath.</q> For Mark's expression,
<pb n="046"/><anchor id="Pg046"/>
(<q>Now when He was risen early the first day of the
week,</q>) we shall read with a pause, putting a comma after
<q>Now when He was risen,</q>&mdash;the sense of the words which
follow being kept separate. Thereby, we shall refer [Mark's]
<q>when He was risen</q> to Matthew's <q>in the end of the Sabbath,</q>
(for it was <emph>then</emph> that He <emph>rose</emph>); and all that comes
after, expressive as it is of a distinct notion, we shall connect
with what follows; (for it was <q><emph>early</emph>, the first day of the
week,</q> that <q>He <emph>appeared to Mary Magdalene</emph>.</q>) This is in
fact what John also declares; for he too has recorded that
<q>early,</q> <q>the first day of the week,</q> [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>]
appeared to the Magdalene. Thus then Mark also says that He appeared
to her early: not that He <emph>rose</emph> early, but long before,
(according to that of Matthew, <q>in the end of the Sabbath:</q>
for though He <emph>rose</emph> then, He did not <emph>appear to Mary</emph> then,
but <q>early.</q>) In a word, two distinct seasons are set before
us by these words: first, the season of the Resurrection,&mdash;which
was <q>in the end of the Sabbath;</q> secondly, the season of our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>'s Appearing,&mdash;which was <q>early.</q> The
former,<note place="foot">The text of Eusebius seems to have experienced some
disarrangement and depravation here.</note>
Mark writes of when he says, (it requires to be read
with a pause,)&mdash;<q>Now, when He was risen,</q> Then, after
a comma, what follows is to be spoken,&mdash;<q>Early, the first

</p>

<p>
1. Let it be freely admitted that what precedes is calculated
at first sight to occasion nothing but surprise and
perplexity. For, in the first place, there really is <emph>no problem
to solve</emph>. The discrepancy suggested by <q>Marinus</q> at the
outset, is plainly imaginary, the result (chiefly) of a strange
misconception of the meaning of the Evangelist's Greek,&mdash;as
in fact no one was ever better aware than Eusebius
himself. <q>These places of the Gospels would never have
occasioned any difficulty,</q> he writes in the very next page,
<pb n="047"/><anchor id="Pg047"/>
(but it is the commencement of his reply to the <emph>second</emph> question
of Marinus,)&mdash;<q>if people would but abstain from assuming
that Matthew's phrase (ὀψὲ σαββάτων) refers to
<emph>the evening of the Sabbath-day</emph>: whereas, (in conformity with
the established idiom of the language,) it obviously refers
to an advanced period of the ensuing night.</q><note place="foot">Mai, iv. 257. So far,
I have given the substance only of what Eusebius delivers with wearisome prolixity. It
follows,&mdash;ὥστε τὸν αὐτὸν σχεδὸν νοεῖσθαι καιρὸν, ἡ τὸν σφόδρα ἐγγὺς, παρὰ τοῖς
εὐαγγελισταῖς διαφόροις ὀνόμασι τετηρημένον. μηδέν τε διαφέρειν Ματθαῖον ἰρηκότα
<q>ὀψὲ&mdash;τάφον</q> [xxviii. 1.] Ἰωάννου φήσαντος <q>τῇ δὲ μιᾷ&mdash;ἔτι οὔσης
σκοτίας.</q> [xx. 1.] πλατυκῶς γὰρ ἕνα καὶ τὸν αὐτὸν δηλοῦσι χρόνον διαφόροις ῥήμασι.
[xxviii. 1.]&mdash;For the principal words in the text,
see the Appendix (B) <hi rend='italic'>ad fin.</hi></note>  He proceeds:&mdash;<q>The
self-same moment therefore, or very nearly
the self-same, is intended by the Evangelists, only under
different names: and there is no discrepancy whatever between
Matthew's,&mdash;<q>in the end of the Sabbath, as it began
to dawn toward the first day of the week,</q> and John's&mdash;<q>The
first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalen early,
when it was yet dark.</q> The Evangelists indicate by different
expressions one and the same moment of time, but
in a broad and general way.</q> And yet, if Eusebius knew
all this so well, why did he not say so at once, and close the
discussion? I really cannot tell; except on one hypothesis,&mdash;which,
although at first it may sound somewhat extraordinary,
the more I think of the matter, recommends itself to my
acceptance the more. I suspect, then, that the discussion
we have just been listening to, is, essentially, <emph>not an original
production</emph>: but that Eusebius, having met with the suggestion
in some older writer, (in Origen probably,) reproduced
it in language of his own,&mdash;doubtless because he thought
it ingenious and interesting, but not by any means because
he regarded it as true. Except on some such theory, I am
utterly unable to understand how Eusebius can have written
so inconsistently. His admirable remarks just quoted, are
obviously a full and sufficient answer,&mdash;the proper answer
in fact,&mdash;to the proposed difficulty: and it is a memorable
circumstance that the ancients generally were so sensible
of this, that they are found to have <emph>invariably</emph><note place="foot">I allude

Marinus for what he wrote in reply to <emph>the first</emph>; in other
words, for the dissertation which is occasioning us all this
difficulty.
</p>

<p>
2. But next, even had the discrepancy been real, the
remedy for it which is here proposed, and which is advocated
with such tedious emphasis, would probably prove
satisfactory to no one. In fact, the entire method advocated
in the foregoing passage is hopelessly vicious. The writer
begins by advancing statements which, if he believed them
to be true, he must have known are absolutely fatal to the
verses in question. This done, he sets about discussing the
possibility of reconciling an isolated expression in S. Mark's
Gospel with another in S. Matthew's: just as if on <emph>that</emph>
depended the genuineness or spuriousness of the entire context:
as if, in short, the major premiss in the discussion
were some such postulate as the following:&mdash;<q>Whatever
in one Gospel cannot be proved to be entirely consistent
with something in another Gospel, is not to be regarded
as genuine.</q> Did then the learned Archbishop of Cæsarea
really suppose that a comma judiciously thrown into the
empty scale might at any time suffice to restore the equilibrium,
and even counterbalance the adverse testimony of
almost every MS. of the Gospels extant? Why does he not
at least deny the truth of the alleged facts to which he
began by giving currency, if not approval; and which, so
long as they are allowed to stand uncontradicted, render all
further argumentation on the subject simply nugatory? As
before, I really cannot tell,&mdash;except on the hypothesis which
has been already hazarded.
</p>

<p>
3. Note also, (for this is not the least extraordinary feature
of the case,) what vague and random statements those
are which we have been listening to. The entire section
<pb n="049"/><anchor id="Pg049"/>
(S. Mark xvi. 9-20,) <q><emph>is not met with in all</emph> the copies:</q> at
all events <emph>not</emph> <q><emph>in the accurate</emph></q> ones. Nay, it is
<q><emph>met with seldom</emph>.</q> In fact, it is <emph>absent from</emph>
<q><emph>almost all</emph></q> copies. But,&mdash;Which
of these four statements is to stand? The first is
comparatively unimportant. Not so the second. The last
two, on the contrary, would be absolutely fatal,&mdash;if trustworthy?
But <emph>are</emph> they trustworthy?
</p>

<p>
To this question only one answer can be returned. The
exaggeration is so gross that it refutes itself. Had it been
merely asserted that the verses in question were wanting in
<emph>many</emph> of the copies,&mdash;even had it been insisted that <emph>the best
copies</emph> were without them,&mdash;well and good: but to assert that,
in the beginning of the fourth century, from <q><emph>almost all</emph></q>
copies of the Gospels they were away,&mdash;is palpably untrue.
What had become then of the MSS. from which the Syriac,
the Latin, <emph>all</emph> the ancient Versions were made? How is the
contradictory evidence of <emph>every copy of the Gospels in existence
but two</emph> to be accounted for? With Irenæus and Hippolytus,
with the old Latin and the Vulgate, with the Syriac,
and the Gothic, and the Egyptian versions to refer to, we
are able to assert that the author of such a statement was
guilty of monstrous exaggeration. We are reminded of the
loose and random way in which the Fathers,&mdash;(giants in
Interpretation, but very children in the Science of Textual
Criticism,)&mdash;are sometimes observed to speak about the state
of the Text in their days. We are reminded, for instance,
of the confident assertion of an ancient Critic that the true
reading in S. Luke xxiv. 13 is not <q>three-score</q> but <q><emph>an
hundred</emph> and three-score;</q> for that so <q>the accurate copies</q>
used to read the place, besides Origen and Eusebius. And
yet (as I have elsewhere explained) the reading ἑκατὸν καὶ
ἑξήκοντα is altogether impossible. <q>Apud nos mixta sunt
omnia,</q> is Jerome's way of adverting to an evil which,
serious as it was, was yet not nearly so great as he represents;
viz. the unauthorized introduction into one Gospel
of what belongs of right to another. And so in a multitude
of other instances. The Fathers are, in fact, constantly observed
to make critical remarks about the ancient copies
which simply <emph>cannot</emph> be correct.
</p>

<pb n="050"/><anchor id="Pg050"/>

<p>
And yet the author of the exaggeration under review, be it
observed, is clearly <emph>not Eusebius</emph>. It is evident that <emph>he</emph> has
nothing to say against the genuineness of the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel. Those random statements about the copies
with which he began, do not even purport to express his
own sentiments. Nay, Eusebius in a manner repudiates
them; for he introduces them with a phrase which separates
them from himself: and, <q>This then is what a person will
say,</q>&mdash;is the remark with which he finally dismisses them.
It would, in fact, be to make this learned Father stultify
himself to suppose that he proceeds gravely to discuss a
portion of Scripture which he had already deliberately rejected
as spurious. But, indeed, the evidence before us
effectually precludes any such supposition. <q>Here are two
readings,</q> he says, <q>(as is so often the case elsewhere:)
<emph>both</emph> of which are to be received,&mdash;inasmuch as by the faithful
and pious, <emph>this</emph> reading is not held to be genuine rather
than <emph>that</emph>; nor <emph>that</emph> than <emph>this</emph>.</q> And
thus we seem to be presented with the actual opinion of Eusebius, as far as it
can be ascertained from the present passage,&mdash;if indeed he
is to be thought here to offer any personal opinion on the
subject at all; which, for my own part, I entirely doubt.
But whether we are at liberty to infer the actual sentiments
of this Father from anything here delivered or not, quite
certain at least is it that to print only the first half of the
passage, (as Tischendorf and Tregelles have done,) and then
to give the reader to understand that he is reading the
adverse testimony of Eusebius as to the genuineness of the
end of S. Mark's Gospel, is nothing else but to misrepresent
the facts of the case; and, however unintentionally, to deceive
those who are unable to verify the quotation for
themselves.
</p>

<p>
It has been urged indeed that Eusebius cannot have recognised
the verses in question as genuine, because a scholium
purporting to be his has been cited by Matthaei from
a Catena at Moscow, in which he appears to assert that
<q>according to Mark,</q> our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> <q>is not recorded to
have appeared to His Disciples after His Resurrection:</q> whereas
in S. Mark xvi. 14 it is plainly recorded that <q>Afterwards
<pb n="051"/><anchor id="Pg051"/>
He appeared unto the Eleven as they sat at meat.</q> May
I be permitted to declare that I am distrustful of the proposed
inference, and shall continue to feel so, until I know
something more about the scholium in question? Up to the
time when this page is printed I have not succeeded in obtaining
from Moscow the details I wish for: but they must
be already on the way, and I propose to embody the result
in a <q>Postscript</q> which shall form the last page of the
Appendix to the present volume.
</p>

<p>
Are we then to suppose that there was no substratum of
truth in the allegations to which Eusebius gives such prominence
in the passage under discussion? By no means.
The mutilated state of S. Mark's Gospel in the Vatican
Codex (B) and especially in the Sinaitic Codex (א) sufficiently
establishes the contrary. Let it be freely conceded,
(but in fact it has been freely conceded already,) that there
must have existed in the time of Eusebius <emph>many</emph> copies of
S. Mark's Gospel which were without the twelve concluding
verses. I do but insist that there is nothing whatever in
that circumstance to lead us to entertain one serious doubt
as to the genuineness of these verses. I am but concerned
to maintain that there is nothing whatever in the evidence
which has hitherto come before us,&mdash;certainly not <emph>in the
evidence of Eusebius</emph>,&mdash;to induce us to believe that they are
a spurious addition to S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
III. We have next to consider what
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome</hi>
</p>

<p>
has delivered on this subject. So great a name must needs
command attention in any question of Textual Criticism:
and it is commonly pretended that Jerome pronounces emphatically
against the genuineness of the last twelve verses
of the Gospel according to S. Mark. A little attention to
the actual testimony borne by this Father will, it is thought,
suffice to exhibit it in a wholly unexpected light; and induce
us to form an entirely different estimate of its practical
bearing upon the present discussion.
</p>

<p>
It will be convenient that I should premise that it is in
one of his many exegetical Epistles that Jerome discusses
this matter. A lady named Hedibia, inhabiting the furthest
<pb n="052"/><anchor id="Pg052"/>
extremity of Gaul, and known to Jerome only by the ardour
of her piety, had sent to prove him with hard questions.
He resolves her difficulties from Bethlehem:<note place="foot">Ep. cxx.
<hi rend='italic'>Opera</hi>, (ed. Vallars.) vol. i. pp. 811-43.</note>
and I may be allowed to remind the reader of what is found to have
been Jerome's practice on similar occasions,&mdash;which, to
judge from his writings, were of constant occurrence. In
fact, Apodemius, who brought Jerome the Twelve problems
from Hedibia, brought him Eleven more from a noble
neighbour of hers, Algasia.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 844.</note>
Once, when a single messenger had conveyed to him out of the African province
a quantity of similar interrogatories, Jerome sent two Egyptian
monks the following account of how he had proceeded
in respect of the inquiry,&mdash;(it concerned 1 Cor. xv. 51,)&mdash;which
they had addressed to him:&mdash;<q>Being pressed for
time, I have presented you with the opinions of all the
Commentators; for the most part, translating their very
words; in order both to get rid of your question, and to
put you in possession of ancient authorities on the subject.</q>
This learned Father does not even profess to have been in
the habit of delivering his own opinions, or speaking his
own sentiments on such occasions. <q>This has been hastily
dictated,</q> he says in conclusion,&mdash;(alluding to his constant
practice, which was to dictate, rather than to write,)&mdash;<q>in
order that I might lay before you what have been the
opinions of learned men on this subject, as well as the arguments
by which they have recommended their opinions.
My own authority, (who am but nothing,) is vastly inferior
to that of our predecessors in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.</q> Then, after
special commendation of the learning of Origen and Eusebius,
and the valuable Scriptural expositions of many more,&mdash;<q>My
plan,</q> (he says,) <q>is to read the ancients; to prove
all things, to hold fast that which is good; and to abide
steadfast in the faith of the Catholic Church.&mdash;I must now
dictate replies, either original or at second-hand, to other
Questions which lie before me.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi>
p. 793-810. See especially pp. 794, 809, 810.</note>
We are not surprised, after this straightforward avowal of what was the method
<pb n="053"/><anchor id="Pg053"/>
on such occasions with this learned Father, to discover that,
instead of hearing <emph>Jerome</emph> addressing <emph>Hedibia</emph>,&mdash;(who had
interrogated him concerning the very problem which is at
present engaging our attention,)&mdash;we find ourselves only
listening to <emph>Eusebius</emph> over again, addressing <emph>Marinus</emph>.
</p>

<p>
<q>This difficulty admits of a two-fold solution,</q> Jerome
begins; as if determined that no doubt shall be entertained
as to the source of his inspiration. Then, (making short
work of the tedious disquisition of Eusebius,)&mdash;<q>Either we
shall reject the testimony of Mark, which is met with in
scarcely any copies of the Gospel,&mdash;almost all the Greek
codices being without this passage:&mdash;(especially since it
seems to narrate what contradicts the other Gospels:)&mdash;or
else, we shall reply that both Evangelists state what is true:
Matthew, when he says that our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> rose <q>late in the
week:</q> Mark,&mdash;when he says that Mary Magdalene saw Him
<q>early, the first day of the week.</q> For the passage must be
thus pointed,&mdash;<q>When He was risen:</q> and presently, after
a pause, must be added,&mdash;<q>Early, the first day of the week,
He appeared to Mary Magdalene.</q> He therefore who had
risen late in the week, according to Matthew,&mdash;Himself,
early the first day of the week, according to Mark, appeared
to Mary Magdalene. And this is what John also means,
shewing that it was early on the next day that He appeared.</q>&mdash;To
understand how faithfully in what precedes
Jerome treads in the footsteps of Eusebius, it is absolutely
necessary to set the Latin of the one over against the Greek
of the other, and to compare them. In order to facilitate
this operation, I have subjoined both originals at foot of the
page: from which it will be apparent that Jerome is here
not so much adopting the sentiments of Eusebius as simply
<emph>translating his words</emph>.<note place="foot"><p><q>Hujus quæstionis duplex

<p>
This, however, is not by any means the strangest feature of
the case. That Jerome should have availed himself ever so
freely of the materials which he found ready to his hand in
the pages of Eusebius cannot be regarded as at all extraordinary,
after what we have just heard from himself of his
customary method of proceeding. It would of course have
suggested the gravest doubts as to whether we were here
listening to the personal sentiment of this Father, or not;
but that would have been all. What are we to think, however,
of the fact that <emph>Hedibia's question to Jerome</emph> proves on
inspection to be nothing more than a translation of <emph>the very
question which Marinus had long before addressed to Eusebius</emph>?
We read on, perplexed at the coincidence; and speedily
make the notable discovery that her next question, and her
next, are <emph>also</emph> translations <emph>word for word</emph> of the next two of
Marinus. For the proof of this statement the reader is again

It is at least decisive:
<pb n="055"/><anchor id="Pg055"/>
and the fact, which admits of only one explanation, can be
attended by only one practical result. It of course shelves
the whole question as far as the evidence of Jerome is concerned.
Whether Hedibia was an actual personage or not,
let those decide who have considered more attentively than
it has ever fallen in my way to do that curious problem,&mdash;What
was the ancient notion of the allowable in Fiction?
That different ideas have prevailed in different ages of the
world as to where fiction ends and fabrication begins;&mdash;that
widely discrepant views are entertained on the subject even
in our own age;&mdash;all must be aware. I decline to investigate
the problem on the present occasion. I do but claim
to have established beyond the possibility of doubt or cavil
that what we are here presented with <emph>is not the testimony of
Jerome at all</emph>. It is evident that this learned Father amused
himself with translating for the benefit of his Latin readers
a part of the (lost) work of Eusebius; (which, by the way,
he is found to have possessed in the same abridged form in
which it has come down to ourselves:)&mdash;and he seems to
have regarded it as allowable to attribute to <q>Hedibia</q> the
problems which he there met with. (He may perhaps have
known that Eusebius before him had attributed them, with
just as little reason, to <q>Marinus.</q>) In that age, for aught
that appears to the contrary, it may have been regarded as
a graceful compliment to address solutions of Scripture difficulties
to persons of distinction, who possibly had never
heard of those difficulties before; and even to represent the
Interrogatories which suggested them as originating with
themselves. I offer this only in the way of suggestion, and
am not concerned to defend it. The only point I am concerned
to establish is that Jerome is here a <emph>translator</emph>, not
an original author: in other words, that it is <emph>Eusebius</emph> who
here speaks, and not Jerome. For a critic to pretend that it
<pb n="056"/><anchor id="Pg056"/>
is in <emph>any</emph> sense the testimony of Jerome which we are here
presented with; that Jerome is one of those Fathers <q>who,
even though they copied from their predecessors, were yet
competent to transmit the record of a fact,</q><note place="foot">Tregelles,
<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 247.</note>&mdash;is entirely to
misunderstand the case. The man who translates,&mdash;not
adopts, but <emph>translates</emph>,&mdash;<emph>the problem</emph> as well as its
solution: who deliberately asserts that it emanated from a Lady inhabiting
the furthest extremity of Gaul, who nevertheless was
demonstrably not its author: who goes on to propose as
hers question after question <emph>verbatim as he found them written
in the pages of Eusebius</emph>; and then resolves them one by one
<emph>in the very language of the same Father</emph>:&mdash;such a writer has
clearly conducted us into a region where his individual responsibility
quite disappears from sight. We must hear no
more about Jerome, therefore, as a witness against the genuineness
of the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
On the contrary. Proof is at hand that Jerome held these
verses to be genuine. The proper evidence of this is supplied
by the fact that he gave them a place in his revision of the
old Latin version of the Scriptures. If he had been indeed
persuaded of their absence from <q><emph>almost all the Greek codices</emph>,</q>
does any one imagine that he would have suffered them to
stand in the Vulgate? If he had met with them in <q><emph>scarcely
any copies of the Gospel</emph></q>&mdash;do men really suppose that he
would yet have retained them? To believe this would, again,
be to forget what was the known practice of this Father;
who, because he found the expression <q>without a cause</q>
(εἰκή,&mdash;S. Matth. v. 22,) only <q>in certain of his codices,</q> but
not <q>in the true ones,</q> <emph>omitted</emph> it from the Vulgate. Because,
however, he read <q>righteousness</q> (where we read <q>alms</q>)
in S. Matth. vi. 1, he exhibits <q><hi rend='italic'>justitiam</hi></q> in his revision
of the old Latin version. On the other hand, though he knew
of MSS. (as he expressly relates) which read <q>works</q> for
<q>children</q> (ἔργων for τέκνων) in S. Matth. xi. 19, he does
not admit that (manifestly corrupt) reading,&mdash;which, however,
is found both in the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex
Sinaiticus. Let this suffice. I forbear to press the matter
further. It is an additional proof that Jerome accepted the
<pb n="057"/><anchor id="Pg057"/>
conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel that he actually quotes it,
and on more than one occasion: but to prove this, is to prove more than
is here required.<note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg028">28</ref>.</note>
I am concerned only to demolish
the assertion of Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and Alford,
and Davidson, and so many more, concerning the testimony of
Jerome; and I have demolished it. I pass on, claiming to
have shewn that the name of Jerome as an adverse witness
must never again appear in this discussion.
</p>

<p>
IV. and V. But now, while the remarks of Eusebius are
yet fresh in the memory, the reader is invited to recall for
a moment what the author of the <q>Homily on the Resurrection,</q>
contained in the works of Gregory of Nyssa (above,
p. <ref target="Pg039">39</ref>), has delivered on the same subject. It will be
remembered that we saw reason for suspecting that not
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Severus of Antioch</hi>, but<lb/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Hesychius of Jerusalem</hi>,
</p>

<p>
(both of them writers of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,) has
the better claim to the authorship of the Homily in question,<note place="foot">See
above, p. <ref target="Pg040">40-1</ref>.</note>&mdash;which,
however, cannot at all events be assigned to the illustrious
Bishop of Nyssa, the brother of Basil the Great. <q>In the
more accurate copies,</q> (says this writer,) <q>the Gospel according
to Mark has its end at <q>for they were afraid.</q> In
some copies, however, this also is added,&mdash;<q>Now when He
was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first
to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.</q>
This, however, seems to contradict to some extent what we
before delivered; for since it happens that the hour of the
night when our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> rose is not known, how does it come
to be here written that He rose <q>early?</q> But the saying
will prove to be no ways contradictory, if we read with skill.
We must be careful intelligently to introduce a comma after,
<q>Now when He was risen:</q> and then to proceed,&mdash;<q>Early in
the Sabbath He appeared first to Mary Magdalene:</q> in order
that <q>when He was risen</q> may refer (in conformity with
what Matthew says) to the foregoing season; while <q>early</q>
is connected with the appearance to Mary.</q><note place="foot">See the
<ref target="Appendix_C">Appendix (C)</ref> § 2.</note>&mdash;I presume it
would be to abuse a reader's patience to offer any remarks
on all this. If a careful perusal of the foregoing passage
<pb n="058"/><anchor id="Pg058"/>
does not convince him that Hesychius is here only reproducing
what he had read in Eusebius, nothing that I can say
will persuade him of the fact. The <emph>words</emph> indeed are by
no means the same; but the sense is altogether identical.
He seems to have also known the work of Victor of Antioch.
However, to remove all doubt from the reader's mind that
the work of Eusebius was in the hands of Hesychius while
he wrote, I have printed in two parallel columns and transferred
to the Appendix what must needs be conclusive;<note place="foot">See the
<ref target="Appendix_C">Appendix (C)</ref> § 1.&mdash;For the statement in line 5, see §
2.</note> for it will be seen that the terms are only not identical in which
Eusebius and Hesychius discuss that favourite problem with
the ancients,&mdash;the consistency of S. Matthew's ὀψὲ τῶν σαββάτων
with the πρωί of S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
It is, however, only needful to read through the Homily
in question to see that it is an attempt to weave into one
piece a quantity of foreign and incongruous materials. It is
in fact not a Homily at all, (though it has been thrown into
that form;) but a Dissertation,&mdash;into which, Hesychius,
(who is known to have been very curious in questions of
that kind<note place="foot">In the <hi rend='italic'>Eccl. Grac. Monumenta</hi> of
Cotelerius, (iii. 1-53,) may be seen the discussion of 60 problems,
headed,&mdash;Συναγωγή ἀποριῶν καὶ ἐπιλύσεων, ἐκλεγεῖσα
ἐν ἐπιτομῇ ἐκ τῆς εὐαγγελικῆς συμφωνίας τοῦ ἁγίου Ἡσυχίου πρεσβυτέρου
Ἱεροσολύμων. From this it appears that Hesychius, following the example of
Eusebius, wrote a work on <q>Gospel Harmony,</q>&mdash;of which nothing but an
abridgment has come down to us.</note>,) is observed to introduce solutions of most of
those famous difficulties which cluster round the sepulchre of
the world's Redeemer on the morning of the first Easter
Day;<note place="foot">He says that he writes,&mdash;Πρὸς τὴν τοῦ ὑποκειμένου προβλήματος
λύσιν, καὶ τῶν ἄλλων τῶν κατὰ τὴν ἐξέτασιν τῶν ῥητῶν ἀναφουμένων ζητήσεων, κ.τ.λ.
Greg. Nyss.<hi rend='italic'> Opp.</hi> iii. 400 c.</note>
and which the ancients seem to have delighted in
discussing,&mdash;as, the number of the Marys who visited the
sepulchre; the angelic appearances on the morning of the
Resurrection; and above all the seeming discrepancy, already
adverted to, in the Evangelical notices of the time at which
our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> rose from the dead. I need not enter more particularly
into an examination of this (so-called) <q>Homily</q>:
but I must not dismiss it without pointing out that its author
<pb n="059"/><anchor id="Pg059"/>
at all events cannot be thought to have repudiated the concluding
verses of S. Mark: for at the end of his discourse,
he quotes the 19th verse entire, without hesitation, in confirmation
of one of his statements, and declares that the
words are written by S. Mark.<note place="foot">ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ τὸ παρὰ τῷ
Μάρκῳ γεγραμμένομ;Ὁ μὲν οῦν Κύριος, κ.τ.λ.
Greg. Nyss. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 415 D.&mdash;See above, p.
<ref target="Pg029">29</ref>, note (g).</note>
</p>

<p>
I shall not be thought unreasonable, therefore, if I contend
that Hesychius is no longer to be cited as a witness in this
behalf: if I point out that it is entirely to misunderstand
and misrepresent the case to quote <emph>a passing allusion of his to
what Eusebius had long before delivered on the same subject</emph>, as
if it exhibited his own individual teaching. It is
demonstrable<note place="foot">See below, <ref target="Chapter_X">chap. X</ref>.</note>
that he is not bearing testimony to the condition of
the MSS. of S. Mark's Gospel in his own age: neither, indeed,
is he bearing testimony <emph>at all</emph>. He is simply amusing
himself, (in what is found to have been his favourite way,)
with reconciling an apparent discrepancy in the Gospels;
and he does it by adopting certain remarks of Eusebius.
Living so late as the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century; conspicuous
neither for his judgment nor his learning; a copyist only, so far as his
remarks on the last verses of S. Mark's Gospel are concerned;&mdash;this
writer does not really deserve the space and
attention we have been compelled to bestow upon him.
</p>

<p>
VI. We may conclude, by inquiring for the evidence
borne by
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch.</hi>
</p>

<p>
And from the familiar style in which this Father's name
is always introduced into the present discussion, no less than
from the invariable practice of assigning to him the date
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 401,</q> it might be supposed that <q>Victor of
Antioch</q> is a well-known personage. Yet is there scarcely a Commentator
of antiquity about whom less is certainly known.
Clinton (who enumerates cccxxii <q>Ecclesiastical Authors</q>
from <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 70 to <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
685<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Fasti Romani</hi>, vol. ii. Appendix viii. pp.
395-495.</note>) does not even record his name.
The recent <q>Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography</q>
is just as silent concerning him. Cramer (his latest editor)
<pb n="060"/><anchor id="Pg060"/>
calls his very existence in question; proposing to attribute
his Commentary on S. Mark to Cyril of Alexandria.<note place="foot">Vol. i.
<hi rend='italic'>Præfat.</hi> p. xxviii. See below, note (p).</note>
Not to delay the reader needlessly,&mdash;Victor of Antioch is an interesting
and unjustly neglected Father of the Church;
whose date,&mdash;(inasmuch as he apparently quotes sometimes
from Cyril of Alexandria who died <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 444, and yet seems
to have written soon after the death of Chrysostom, which
took place <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 407), may be assigned to the first half of the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,&mdash;suppose
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 425-450. And in citing him
I shall always refer to the best (and most easily accessible)
edition of his work,&mdash;that of Cramer (1840) in the first
volume of his <q>Catenae.</q>
</p>

<p>
But a far graver charge is behind. From the confident
air in which Victor's authority is appealed to by those who
deem the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel spurious,
it would of course be inferred that his evidence is hostile
to the verses in question; whereas his evidence to their
genuineness is the most emphatic and extraordinary on
record. Dr. Tregelles asserts that <q>his <emph>testimony</emph> to the
absence of these twelve verses from some or many copies,
stands in contrast to his own <emph>opinion</emph> on the subject.</q> But
Victor delivers <emph>no</emph> <q>opinion:</q> and his <q>testimony</q> is the
direct reverse of what Dr. Tregelles asserts it to be. This
learned and respected critic has strangely misapprehended
the evidence.<note place="foot"><q>Victor Antiochenus</q> (writes Dr. Tregelles in his
N. T. vol. i. p. 214,) <q>dicit ὅτι νενόθενται τὸ παρὰ Μάρκῳ τελευταῖον ἔν τισι
φερόμενον.</q></note>
</p>

<p>
I must needs be brief in this place. I shall therefore
confine myself to those facts concerning <q>Victor of Antioch,</q>
or rather concerning his work, which are necessary for the
purpose in hand.<note place="foot">For additional details concerning Victor of
Antioch, and his work, the studious in such matters are referred to the
<ref target="Appendix_D">Appendix (D)</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Now, his Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel,&mdash;as all must
see who will be at the pains to examine it,&mdash;is to a great
extent a compilation. The same thing may be said, no
doubt, to some extent, of almost every ancient Commentary
in existence. But I mean, concerning this particular work,
<pb n="061"/><anchor id="Pg061"/>
that it proves to have been the author's plan not so much
to give the general results of his acquaintance with the
writings of Origen, Apollinarius, Theodorus of Mopsuestia,
Eusebius, and Chrysostom; as, with or without acknowledgment,
to transcribe largely (but with great license)
from one or other of these writers. Thus, the whole of his
note on S. Mark xv. 38, 39, is taken, without any hint that
it is not original, (much of it, <emph>word for word</emph>,) from Chrysostom's
88th Homily on S. Matthew's Gospel.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol.
vii. p. 825 E-826 B: or, in Field's edition, p. 527, line 3 to 20.</note>
The same is to be said of the first twelve lines of his note on
S. Mark xvi. 9. On the other hand, the latter half of the
note last mentioned professes to give the substance of what
<emph>Eusebius</emph> had written on the same subject. It is in fact an
extract from those very <q>Quaestiones ad Marinum</q> concerning
which so much has been offered already. All this,
though it does not sensibly detract from the interest or the
value of Victor's work, must be admitted entirely to change
the character of his supposed evidence. He comes before
us rather in the light of a Compiler than of an Author: his
work is rather a <q>Catena</q> than a Commentary: and as
such in fact it is generally described. Quite plain is it, at
all events, that the sentiments contained in the sections last
referred to, are <emph>not Victor's at all</emph>. For one half of them,
no one but Chrysostom is responsible: for the other half, no
one but Eusebius.
</p>

<p>
But it is Victor's familiar use of the writings of Eusebius,&mdash;especially
of those Resolutions of hard Questions <q>concerning
the seeming Inconsistencies in the Evangelical accounts
of the Resurrection,</q> which Eusebius addressed to Marinus,&mdash;on
which the reader's attention is now to be concentrated.
Victor cites that work of Eusebius <emph>by name</emph> in the very
<emph>first</emph> page of his Commentary. That his <emph>last</emph> page also contains
a quotation from it, (also <emph>by name</emph>), has been already pointed
out.<note place="foot">Cramer, i. p. 266, lines 10, 11,&mdash;ὥς φησιν Εὐσέβιος ὁ
Καισαρείας ἐν τῷ πρὸς Μαρῖνον κ.τ.λ. And at p. 446, line 19,&mdash;Εὐσεβιός φησιν ὁ
Καισαρείας κ.τ.λ.</note>
Attention is now invited to what is found concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 in the <emph>last page but one</emph> (p. 444) of
<pb n="062"/><anchor id="Pg062"/>
Victor's work. It shall be given in English; because I will
convince unlearned as well as learned readers. Victor, (after
quoting four lines from the 89<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Homily of
Chrysostom<note place="foot">Compare Cramer's <hi rend='italic'>Vict. Ant.</hi> i. p.
444, line 6-9, with Field's <hi rend='italic'>Chrys.</hi> iii. p. 539, line
7-21.</note>), reconciles (exactly as Eusebius is observed to
do<note place="foot">Mai, iv. p. 257-8.</note>) the notes
of time contained severally in S. Matth. xxviii. 1, S. Mark
xvi. 2, S. Luke xxiv. 1, and S. John xx. 1. After which,
he proceeds as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>In certain copies of Mark's Gospel, next comes,&mdash;<q>Now
when [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>] was risen early the first day of the week, He
appeared to Mary Magdalene;</q>&mdash;a statement which seems
inconsistent with Matthew's narrative. This might be met
by asserting, that the conclusion of Mark's Gospel, though
found in certain copies, is spurious, However, that we may
not seem to betake ourselves to an off-hand answer, we
propose to read the place thus:&mdash;<q>Now when [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>] was
risen:</q> then, after a comma, to go on,&mdash;<q>early the first day
of the week He appeared to Mary Magdalene.</q> In this
way we refer [Mark's] <q>Now when [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>] was risen</q> to
Matthew's <q>in the end of the sabbath,</q> (for <emph>then</emph> we believe
Him to have <emph>risen</emph>;) and all that comes after, expressive as
it is of a different notion, we connect with what follows.
Mark relates that He who <q><emph>arose</emph> (according to Matthew) <emph>in
the end of the Sabbath</emph>,</q> <emph>was seen</emph> by Mary Magdalene
<q><emph>early</emph>.</q>
This is in fact what John also declares; for he too has recorded
that <q>early,</q> <q>the first day of the week,</q> [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>]
appeared to the Magdalene. In a word, two distinct seasons
are set before us by these words: first, the season of the
Resurrection,&mdash;which was <q>in the end of the Sabbath;</q>
secondly, the season of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Appearing,&mdash;which
was <q>early.</q></q><note place="foot">Cramer, vol. i. p. 444, line 19 to p. 445,
line 4.</note>
</p>

<p>
No one, I presume, can read this passage and yet hesitate
to admit that he is here listening to Eusebius <q>ad Marinum</q>
over again. But if any one really retains a particle
of doubt on the subject, he is requested to cast his eye to
the foot of the present page; and even an unlearned reader,
<pb n="063"/><anchor id="Pg063"/>
surveying the originals with attention, may easily convince
himself that <emph>Victor is here nothing else but a
copyist</emph>.<note place="foot"><p>The following is the original of what is given

</p>
<p>Note, that Victor <emph>twice</emph> omits the word πρῶτον, and <emph>twice</emph>
reads τῇ μιᾷ τοῦ σαββάτου, (instead of πρῶτῃ σαββάτου), <emph>only because Eusebius had
inadvertently</emph> (three times) <emph>done the same thing</emph> in the place from
which Victor is copying. See Mai. <hi rend="italic">Nova P. P. Bibl.</hi> iv. p.
256, line 19 and 26: p. 257 line 4 and 5.</p>
</note>
That the work in which Eusebius reconciles <q>seeming discrepancies
in the Evangelical narratives,</q> was actually lying open
before Victor while he wrote, is ascertained beyond dispute.
He is observed in his next ensuing Comment to quote from
it, and to mention Eusebius as its author. At the end of
the present note he has a significant allusion to Eusebius:&mdash;<q>I
<pb n="064"/><anchor id="Pg064"/>
know very well,</q> he says, <q>what has been suggested <emph>by
those who are at the pains to remove the apparent inconsistencies
in this place</emph>.</q><note place="foot">οὐκ ἀγνοῶ δἐ ὡς διαφόρους ὀπτασίας γεγενῆσθαί
φασιν οἱ τὴν δοκοῦσαν διαφωνίαν διαλῦσαι σπουδάζοντες.
Vict. Ant. <hi rend='italic'>ed. Cramer</hi>, vol. i. p. 445, l. 23-5:
referring to what Eusebius says <hi rend='italic'>apud Mai</hi>, iv. 264 and 265
(§ iiii): 287-290 (§§ v, vi, vii.)</note>
But when writing on S. Mark xvi. 9-20,
he does more. After abridging, (as his manner is,) what
Eusebius explains with such tedious emphasis, (giving the
substance of five columns in about three times as many
lines,) he adopts the exact expressions of Eusebius,&mdash;follows
him in his very mistakes,&mdash;and finally transcribes his words.
The reader is therefore requested to bear in mind that what
he has been listening to is <emph>not the testimony of Victor at all</emph>:
but <emph>the testimony of Eusebius</emph>. This is but one more echo
therefore of a passage of which we are all beginning by this
time to be weary; so exceedingly rash are the statements
with which it is introduced, so utterly preposterous the proposed
method of remedying a difficulty which proves after
all to be purely imaginary.
</p>

<p>
What then <emph>is</emph> the testimony of Victor? Does he offer any
independent statement on the question in dispute, from
which his own private opinion (though nowhere stated) may
be lawfully inferred? Yes indeed. Victor, though frequently
a Transcriber only, is observed every now and then
to come forward in his own person, and deliver his individual
sentiment.<note place="foot">e.g. in the passage last quoted.</note>
But nowhere throughout his work
does he deliver such remarkable testimony as in this place.
Hear him!
</p>

<p>
<q>Notwithstanding that in very many copies of the present
Gospel, the passage beginning, <q>Now when [<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>] was risen
early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene,</q>
be not found,&mdash;(certain individuals having supposed it to
be spurious,)&mdash;yet <hi rend="smallcaps">we</hi>, at all events,
inasmuch as in very many we have discovered it to exist, have, out of accurate
copies, subjoined also the account of our Lord's
Ascension, (following the words <q>for they were afraid,</q>)
in conformity with the Palestinian exemplar of Mark
<pb n="065"/><anchor id="Pg065"/>
which exhibits the Gospel verity: that is to say, from
the words, <q>Now when [Jesus] was risen early the
first day of the week,</q> &amp;c., down to <q>with signs following.
Amen.</q><note place="foot">For the original of this remarkable passage the reader
is referred to the <ref target="Appendix_E">Appendix (E)</ref>.</note>&mdash;And with
these words Victor of Antioch brings his Commentary on S. Mark to an end.</q>
</p>

<p>
Here then we find it roundly stated by a highly intelligent
Father, writing in the first half of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1.) That the reason why the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark
are absent from some ancient copies of his Gospel is <emph>because
they have been deliberately omitted by Copyists</emph>:
</p>

<p>
(2.) That the ground for such omission was the <emph>subjective
judgment</emph> of individuals,&mdash;<emph>not</emph> the result of any appeal to
documentary evidence. Victor, therefore, clearly held that
the Verses in question had been <emph>expunged</emph> in consequence of
their (seeming) inconsistency with what is met with in the
other Gospels:
</p>

<p>
(3.) That he, on the other hand, had convinced himself
by reference to <q>very many</q> and <q>accurate</q> copies, that
the verses in question are genuine:
</p>

<p>
(4.) That in particular the Palestinian Copy, which enjoyed
the reputation of <q>exhibiting the genuine text of
S. Mark,</q> contained the Verses in dispute.&mdash;To <emph>Opinion</emph>,
therefore, Victor opposes <emph>Authority</emph>. He makes his appeal
to the most trustworthy documentary evidence with which
he is acquainted; and the deliberate testimony which he
delivers is a complete counterpoise and antidote to the loose
phrases of Eusebius on the same subject:
</p>

<p>
(5.) That in consequence of all this, following the Palestinian
Exemplar, he had from accurate copies <emph>furnished his
own work with the Twelve Verses in dispute</emph>;&mdash;which is a categorical
refutation of the statement frequently met with that
the work of Victor of Antioch is <emph>without</emph> them.
</p>

<p>
We are now at liberty to sum up; and to review the progress
which has been hitherto made in this Inquiry.
</p>

<p>
Six Fathers of the Church have been examined who are
commonly represented as bearing hostile testimony to the
last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel; and they have been
<pb n="066"/><anchor id="Pg066"/>
easily reduced to <emph>one</emph>. Three of them, (Hesychius, Jerome,
Victor,) prove to be echoes, not voices. The remaining two,
(Gregory of Nyssa and Severus,) are neither voices nor
echoes, but merely <emph>names</emph>: <hi rend="smallcaps">Gregory of Nyssa</hi> having
really no more to do with this discussion than Philip of Macedon;
and <q>Severus</q> and <q>Hesychius</q> representing one and the
same individual. Only by a Critic seeking to mislead his
reader will any one of these five Fathers be in future cited
as witnessing against the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
Eusebius is the solitary witness who survives the ordeal of
exact inquiry.<note place="foot">How shrewdly was it remarked by Matthaei, eighty years
ago,&mdash;<q>Scholia certe, in quibus de integritate hujus loci dubitatur, omnia
<emph>ex uno fonte promanarunt</emph>. Ex eodem fonte Hieronymum etiam hausisse
intelligitur ex ejus loco quem laudavit Wetst. ad ver. 9.&mdash;Similiter Scholiastæ
omnes in principio hujus Evangelii in disputatione de lectione ἐν ἡσαίᾳ τῷ προφήτη
ex uno pendent. <emph>Fortasse Origenes auctor est hujus dubitationis.</emph></q>
(N.T. vol. ii. p. 270.)&mdash;The reader is invited to remember what was offered above
in p. 47 (line 23.)</note> But,
</p>

<p>
I. <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>, (as we have seen), instead of proclaiming his
distrust of this portion of the Gospel, enters upon an elaborate
proof that its contents are not inconsistent with what
is found in the Gospels of S. Matthew and S. John. His
testimony is reducible to two innocuous and wholly unconnected
propositions: the first,&mdash;That there existed in his
day a vast number of copies in which the last chapter of
S. Mark's Gospel ended abruptly at ver. 8; (the correlative
of which of course would be that there also existed a vast
number which were furnished with the present ending.) The
second,&mdash;That by putting a comma after the word Ἀναστάς,
S. Mark xvi. 9, is capable of being reconciled with S. Matth.
xxviii. 1<note place="foot">It is not often, I think, that one finds in MSS. a point
actually inserted after Ἀναστάς δέ. Such a point is found, however, in Cod. 34
( = Coisl. 195,) and Cod. 22 ( = Reg. 72,) and doubtless in many other copies.</note>....
I profess myself unable to understand how
it can be pretended that Eusebius would have subscribed to
the opinion of Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest, that the
Gospel of S. Mark was never finished by its inspired Author,
or was mutilated before it came abroad; at all events, that
the last Twelve Verses are spurious.
</p>

<pb n="067"/><anchor id="Pg067"/>

<p>
II. The observations of Eusebius are found to have been
adopted, and in part transcribed, by an unknown writer of
the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,&mdash;whether
<hi rend="smallcaps">Hesychius</hi> or <hi rend="smallcaps">Severus</hi> is not certainly
known: but if it were Hesychius, then it was not
Severus; if Severus, then not Hesychius. This writer, however,
(whoever he may have been,) is careful to convince us
that individually he entertained <emph>no doubt whatever</emph> about the
genuineness of this part of Scripture, for he says that he
writes in order to remove the (hypothetical) objections of
others, and to silence their (imaginary) doubts. Nay, he
freely <emph>quotes the verses as genuine</emph>, and declares that they were
read in his day on a certain Sunday night in the public
Service of the Church.... To represent such an one,&mdash;(it
matters nothing, I repeat, whether we call him <q>Hesychius
of Jerusalem</q> or <q>Severus of Antioch,</q>)&mdash;as a hostile witness,
is simply to misrepresent the facts of the case. He is,
on the contrary, the strenuous champion of the verses which
he is commonly represented as impugning.
</p>

<p>
III. As for <hi rend="smallcaps">Jerome</hi>, since that illustrious Father comes
before us in this place as a <emph>translator</emph> of Eusebius only, he is
no more responsible for what Eusebius says concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, than Hobbes of Malmesbury is responsible
for anything that Thucydides has related concerning
the Peloponnesian war. Individually, however, it is certain
that Jerome was convinced of the genuineness of S. Mark
xvi. 9-20: for in two different places of his writings he not
only quotes the 9th and 14th verses, but he exhibits all the
twelve in the Vulgate.
</p>

<p>
IV. Lastly, <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch</hi>, who wrote in an age when
Eusebius was held to be an infallible oracle on points of
Biblical Criticism,&mdash;having dutifully rehearsed, (like the
rest,) the feeble expedient of that illustrious Father for harmonizing
S. Mark xvi. 9 with the narrative of S. Matthew,&mdash;is
observed to cite the statements of Eusebius concerning
<emph>the last Twelve Verses</emph> of S. Mark, only in order to refute
them. Not that he opposes opinion to opinion,&mdash;(for the
opinions of Eusebius and of Victor of Antioch on this behalf
were probably identical;) but statement he meets with
counter-statement,&mdash;fact he confronts with fact. Scarcely
<pb n="068"/><anchor id="Pg068"/>
can anything be imagined more emphatic than his testimony,
or more conclusive.
</p>

<p>
For the reader is requested to observe that here is an
Ecclesiastic, writing in the first half of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, who <emph>expressly witnesses to the genuineness</emph> of the Verses in
dispute. He had made reference, he says, and ascertained their
existence in very many MSS. (ὡς ἐν πλείστοις). He had
derived his text from <q>accurate</q> ones: (ἐξ ἀκριβῶν ἀντιγράφων.)
More than that: he leads his reader to infer that
he had personally resorted to the famous Palestinian Copy,
the text of which was held to exhibit the inspired verity,
and had satisfied himself that the concluding section of S.
Mark's Gospel <emph>was there</emph>. He had, therefore, been either to Jerusalem,
or else to Cæsarea; had inquired for those venerable
records which had once belonged to Origen and Pamphilus;<note place="foot">Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, pp. 47, 125, 431.</note>
and had inspected them. Testimony more express, more
weighty,&mdash;I was going to say, more decisive,&mdash;can scarcely
be imagined. It may with truth be said to close the present
discussion.
</p>

<p>
With this, in fact, Victor lays down his pen. So also
may I. I submit that nothing whatever which has hitherto
come before us lends the slightest countenance to the modern
dream that S. Mark's Gospel, as it left the hands of its inspired
Author, ended abruptly at ver. 8. Neither Eusebius
nor Jerome; neither Severus of Antioch nor Hesychius of
Jerusalem; certainly not Victor of Antioch; least of all
Gregory of Nyssa,&mdash;yield a particle of support to that monstrous
fancy. The notion is an invention, a pure imagination
of the Critics ever since the days of Griesbach.
</p>

<p>
It remains to be seen whether the MSS. will prove somewhat
less unaccommodating.
</p>

<p>
VII. For it can be of no possible avail, at this stage of
the discussion, to appeal to
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Euthymius Zigabenus</hi>,
</p>

<p>
the Author of an interesting Commentary, or rather Compilation
on the Gospels, assigned to <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 1116. Euthymius lived,
in fact, full five hundred years too late for his testimony to
be of the slightest importance. Such as it is, however, it is
<pb n="069"/><anchor id="Pg069"/>
not unfavourable. He says,&mdash;<q>Some of the Commentators
state that here,</q> (viz. at ver. 8,) <q>the Gospel according to
Mark finishes; and that what follows is a spurious addition.</q>
(Which clearly is his version of the statements of one
or more of the four Fathers whose testimony has already
occupied so large a share of our attention.) <q>This portion we
must also interpret, however,</q> (Euthymius proceeds,) <q>since
there is nothing in it prejudicial to the truth.</q><note place="foot">Φασὶ δέ τινες
τῶν ἐξηγητῶν ἐνταῦθα συμπληροῦσθαι τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον;
τὰ δὲ ἐφεξῆς προσθήκην εἶναι μεταγενεστέραν. Χρὴ δὲ καὶ ταύτην
ἑρμηνεῦσαι μηδὲν τῇ ἀληθείᾳ λυμαινομένην.&mdash;Euthym. Zig.
(<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> Matthaei, 1792), <hi rend='italic'>in
loc.</hi></note>&mdash;But it is
idle to linger over such a writer. One might almost as well
quote <q>Poli <hi rend='italic'>Synopsis</hi></q> and then proceed to discuss it. The
cause must indeed be desperate which seeks support from
a quarter like this. What possible sanction can an Ecclesiastic
of the xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century be supposed to yield to the
hypothesis that S. Mark's Gospel, as it left the hands of its inspired
Author, was an unfinished work?
</p>

<p>
It remains to ascertain what is the evidence of the MSS.
on this subject. And the MSS. require to be the more
attentively studied, because it is to <emph>them</emph> that our opponents
are accustomed most confidently to appeal. On them in
fact they rely. The nature and the value of the most ancient
Manuscript testimony available, shall be scrupulously investigated
in the next two Chapters.

The two oldest Copies of the Gospels in existence are the
famous Codex in the Vatican Library at Rome, known as
<q>Codex B;</q> and the Codex which Tischendorf brought from
Mount Sinai in 1859, and which he designates by the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet (א). These two manuscripts are
probably not of equal antiquity.<note place="foot">For some remarks on this subject the
reader is referred to the <ref target="Appendix_F">Appendix (F)</ref>.</note>
An interval of fifty years
at least seems to be required to account for the marked difference
between them. If the first belongs to the beginning,
the second may be referred to the middle or latter part of
the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century. But the two
Manuscripts agree in this,&mdash;that
<emph>they are without the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel</emph>.
In both, after ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ (ver. 8), comes the subscription:
in Cod. B,&mdash;ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ; in Cod. א,&mdash;ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ
ΜΑΡΚΟΝ.
</p>

<p>
Let it not be supposed that we have any <emph>more</emph> facts of this
class to produce. All has been stated. It is not that the
evidence of Manuscripts is one,&mdash;the evidence of Fathers
and Versions another. The very reverse is the case. Manuscripts,
Fathers, and Versions alike, are <emph>only not unanimous</emph>
in bearing consistent testimony. But the consentient witness
<pb n="071"/><anchor id="Pg071"/>
of the MSS. is even extraordinary. With the exception of
the two uncial MSS. which have just been named, there is
<emph>not one</emph> Codex in existence, uncial or cursive,&mdash;(and we are
acquainted with, at least, eighteen other uncials,<note place="foot">Viz. A, C [v];
D [vi]; E, L [viii]; F, K, M, V, Γ, Δ, Λ (quære), Π [ix];
G, H, X, S, U [ix, x].</note> and about
six hundred cursive Copies of this Gospel,)&mdash;which leaves out
the last twelve verses of S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
The inference which an unscientific observer would draw
from this fact, is no doubt in this instance the correct one.
He demands to be shewn the Alexandrine (A) and the Parisian
Codex (C),&mdash;neither of them probably removed by much
more than fifty years from the date of the Codex Sinaiticus,
and both unquestionably <emph>derived from different originals</emph>;&mdash;and
he ascertains that no countenance is lent by either of
those venerable monuments to the proposed omission of this
part of the sacred text. He discovers that the Codex Bezae
(D), the only remaining very ancient MS. authority,&mdash;notwithstanding
that it is observed on most occasions to exhibit
an extraordinary sympathy with the Vatican (B),&mdash;here sides
with A and C against B and א. He inquires after all the
other uncials and all the cursive MSS. in existence, (some
of them dating from the x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,) and
requests to have it explained to him <emph>why</emph> it is to be supposed that all these
many witnesses,&mdash;belonging to so many different patriarchates,
provinces, ages of the Church,&mdash;have entered into
a grand conspiracy to bear false witness on a point of this
magnitude and importance? But he obtains no intelligible
answer to this question. How, then, is an unprejudiced
student to draw any inference but one from the premisses?
<emph>That</emph> single peculiarity (he tells himself) of bringing the
second Gospel abruptly to a close at the 8th verse of the
xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter, is absolutely fatal to the two
Codices in question. It is useless to din into his ears that those Codices
are probably both of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century,&mdash;unless men are prepared to add the assurance that a Codex of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century is <emph>of necessity</emph>
a more trustworthy witness to the text of the
Gospels than a Codex of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>. The omission of
these twelve verses, I repeat, in itself, destroys his confidence in
<pb n="072"/><anchor id="Pg072"/>
Cod. B and Cod. א: for it is obvious that a copy of the Gospels
which has been so seriously mutilated in one place may
have been slightly tampered with in another. He is willing
to suspend his judgment, of course. The two oldest copies of
the Gospels in existence are entitled to great reverence <emph>because</emph>
of their high antiquity. They must be allowed a most
patient, most unprejudiced, most respectful, nay, a most
indulgent hearing. But when all this has been freely accorded,
on no intelligible principle can more be claimed for
any two MSS. in the world.
</p>

<p>
The rejoinder to all this is sufficiently obvious. Mistrust
will no doubt have been thrown over the evidence borne to
the text of Scripture in a thousand other places by Cod. B
and Cod. א, <emph>after demonstration that those two Codices exhibit
a mutilated text</emph> in the present place. But what else is this
but the very point requiring demonstration? Why may
not these two be right, and all the other MSS. wrong?
</p>

<p>
I propose, therefore, that we reverse the process. Proceed
we to examine the evidence borne by these two witnesses
on certain <emph>other</emph> occasions which admit of <emph>no</emph> difference of
opinion; or next to none. Let us endeavour, I say, to ascertain
<emph>the character of the Witnesses</emph> by a patient and unprejudiced
examination of their Evidence,&mdash;not in one place,
or in two, or in three; but on several important occasions,
and throughout. If we find it invariably consentient and
invariably truthful, then of course a mighty presumption
will have been established, the very strongest possible, that
their adverse testimony in respect of the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel must needs be worthy of all acceptation.
But if, on the contrary, our inquiries shall conduct us to
the very opposite result,&mdash;what else can happen but that
our confidence in these two MSS. will be hopelessly shaken?
We must in such case be prepared to admit that it is just
as likely as not that this is only <emph>one more occasion</emph> on which
these <q>two false witnesses</q> have conspired to witness falsely.
If, at this juncture, extraneous evidence of an entirely trustworthy
kind can be procured to confront them: above all,
if some one ancient witness of unimpeachable veracity can
be found who shall bear contradictory evidence: what other
<pb n="073"/><anchor id="Pg073"/>
alternative will be left us but to reject their testimony in
respect of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 with something like indignation;
and to acquiesce in the belief of universal Christendom
for eighteen hundred years that these twelve verses are
just as much entitled to our unhesitating acceptance as any
other twelve verses in the Gospel which can be named?
</p>

<p>
I. It is undeniable, in the meantime, that for the last
quarter of a century, it has become the fashion to demand
for the readings of Codex B something very like absolute
deference. The grounds for this superstitious sentiment,
(for really I can describe it in no apter way,) I profess
myself unable to discover. Codex B comes to us without
a history: without recommendation of any kind, except that
of its antiquity. It bears traces of careless transcription in
every page. The mistakes which the original transcriber
made are of perpetual recurrence. <q>They are chiefly omissions,
of one, two, or three words; but sometimes of half
a verse, a whole verse, or even of several verses.... I hesitate
not to assert that it would be easier to find a folio containing
three or four such omissions than to light on one
which should be without
any.</q><note place="foot">Vercellone,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Del antichissimo Codice

<pb n="074"/><anchor id="Pg074"/>
from an older Codex which contained about twelve
or thirteen letters in a line.<note place="foot"><p>In this way, (at S. John xvii. 15,
16), the obviously corrupt reading of Cod. B (ινα τηρησης αυτους εκ του
κοσμου)&mdash;which, however, was the reading of the copy used by Athanasius
(<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> p. 1035: <hi rend='italic'>al. ed.</hi> p. 825)&mdash;is

</p>
<p>
ΕΝ ΤΩ ΙΕΡΩ [ΑΙΝ<lb/>
ΟΥΝΤΕΣ ΚΑΙ] ΕΥΛΟ<lb/>

</p>
<p>
And why B (with א, L) omits an important clause in the history of the Temptation
(S. Luke iv. 5) :&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ΚΑΙ ΑΝΑΓΑΓΩΝ ΑΥ<lb/>
ΤΟΝ [ΕΙΣ ΟΡΟΣ ΥΨΗ<lb/>

</p></note> And it will be found that
some of its omissions which have given rise to prolonged
<pb n="075"/><anchor id="Pg075"/>
discussion are probably to be referred to nothing else but the
oscitancy of a transcriber with such a codex before him:<note place="foot"><p>In this way
the famous omission (א, B, L) of the word δευτεροπρώτῳ, in
S. Luke vi. 1, is (to say the least) capable of being explained:&mdash;

</p></note>
without having recourse to any more abstruse hypothesis;
without any imputation of bad faith;&mdash;<emph>certainly without
supposing that the words omitted did not exist in the inspired
autograph of the Evangelist</emph>. But then it is undeniable that
some of the omissions in Cod. B are not to be so explained.
On the other hand, I can testify to the fact that the codex
is disfigured throughout with <emph>repetitions</emph>. The original scribe
is often found to have not only written the same words twice
over, but to have failed whenever he did so to take any
notice with his pen of what he had done.
</p>

<p>
What then, (I must again inquire,) are the grounds for
the superstitious reverence which is entertained in certain
quarters for the readings of Codex B? If it be a secret
known to the recent Editors of the New Testament, they
have certainly contrived to keep it wondrous close.
</p>

<p>
II. More recently, a claim to co-ordinate primacy has
been set up on behalf of the Codex Sinaiticus. Tischendorf
is actually engaged in remodelling his seventh Leipsic edition,
chiefly in conformity with the readings of his lately
discovered MS.<note place="foot">He has reached the 480th page of vol. ii.
(1 Cor. v. 7.)</note> And yet the Codex in question abounds
with <q>errors of the the eye and pen, to an extent not unparalleled,
but happily rather unusual in documents of first-rate
importance.</q> On many occasions, 10, 20, 30, 40 words
are dropped through very carelessness.<note place="foot">In this way 14 words have
been omitted from Cod. א in S. Mark xv. 47&mdash;xvi. 1:&mdash;19 words in S. Mark i.
32-4:&mdash;20 words in S. John xx. 5, 6:&mdash;39 words in S. John xix. 20, 21.</note>
<q>Letters and words, even whole sentences, are frequently written twice
<pb n="076"/><anchor id="Pg076"/>
over, or begun and immediately cancelled: while that gross
blunder ... whereby a clause is omitted because it happens to
end in the same words as the clause preceding, occurs no less
than 115 times in the New Testament. Tregelles has freely
pronounced that <q>the state of the text, as proceeding from
the first scribe, may be regarded as <emph>very
rough</emph>.</q></q><note place="foot">Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Full
Collation</hi>, &amp;c., p. xv.; quoting Tregelles' N. T. Part II. page ii.</note> But
when <q>the first scribe</q> and his <q>very rough</q> performance
have been thus unceremoniously disposed of, one would
like to be informed what remains to command respect in
Codex א? Is, then, <emph>manuscript authority</emph> to be confounded
with <emph>editorial caprice</emph>,&mdash;exercising itself upon the corrections
of <q>at least ten different revisers,</q> who, from the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> to the
xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, have been endeavouring to lick into
shape a text which its original author left <q><emph>very rough</emph>?</q>
</p>

<p>
The co-ordinate primacy, (as I must needs call it,) which,
within the last few years, has been claimed for Codex B
and Codex א, threatens to grow into a species of tyranny,&mdash;from
which I venture to predict there will come in the end
an unreasonable and unsalutary recoil. It behoves us, therefore,
to look closely into this matter, and to require a reason
for what is being done. The text of the sacred deposit is
far too precious a thing to be sacrificed to an irrational, or
at least a superstitious devotion to two MSS.,&mdash;simply because
they may possibly be older by a hundred years than
any other which we possess. <q>Id verius quod prius,</q> is an
axiom which holds every bit as true in Textual Criticism as
in Dogmatic Truth. But on that principle, (as I have already
shewn,) the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel are fully
established;<note place="foot">See <ref target="Chapter_IV">Chap. IV</ref>.
p. <ref target="Pg037">37</ref>.</note> and by consequence, the credit of Codd. B
and א sustains a severe shock. Again, <q>Id verius quod
prius;</q> but it does not of course follow that a Codex of
the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century shall
exhibit a more correct text of Scripture than one written in the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, or even than one written
in the x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>. For the proof of this
statement, (if it can be supposed
to require proof,) it is enough to appeal to Codex D.
That venerable copy of the Gospels is of the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century.
<pb n="077"/><anchor id="Pg077"/>
It is, in fact, one of our five great uncials. No older MS. of
the Greek Text is known to exist,&mdash;excepting always A, B, C
and א. And yet <emph>no</emph> text is more thoroughly disfigured by
corruptions and interpolations than that of Codex D. In the
Acts, (to use the language of its learned and accurate Editor,)
<q>it is hardly an exaggeration to assert that it reproduces
the <emph>textus receptus</emph> much in the same way that one of the
best Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew of the Old Testament:
so wide are the variations in the diction, so constant
and inveterate the practice of expanding the narrative by
means of interpolations which seldom recommend themselves
as genuine by even a semblance of internal
probability.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction to Con.
Bezae</hi>, p. liv.</note> Where, then, is the <hi rend='italic'>à priori</hi>
probability that two MSS. of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century shall have not only a superior claim to be heard,
but almost an exclusive right to dictate which readings are
to be rejected, which retained?
</p>

<p>
How ready the most recent editors of the New Testament
have shewn themselves to hammer the sacred text on the
anvil of Codd. B and א,&mdash;not unfrequently in defiance of the
evidence of all other MSS., and sometimes to the serious
detriment of the deposit,&mdash;would admit of striking illustration
were this place for such details. Tischendorf's English
<q><emph>New Testament</emph></q>&mdash;<q>with various readings from the three
most celebrated manuscripts of the Greek Text</q> translated
at the foot of every page,&mdash;is a recent attempt (1869) to
popularize the doctrine that we have to look exclusively to
two or three of the oldest copies, if we would possess the
Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> in its integrity. Dean Alford's constant appeal
in his revision of the Authorized Version (1870) to <q>the
oldest MSS.</q> (meaning thereby generally Codd. א and B
with one or two others<note place="foot">e.g. in S. John i. 42 (meaning only א, B, L):
iv. 42 (א, B, C): v. 12 (א, B, C, L): vi. 22 (A, B, L), &amp;c.</note>), is
an abler endeavour to familiarize the public mind with the same belief. I am bent on
shewing that there is nothing whatever in the character of
either of the Codices in question to warrant this servile
deference.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) And first,&mdash;Ought it not sensibly to detract from our
<pb n="078"/><anchor id="Pg078"/>
opinion of the value of their evidence to discover that <emph>it is
easier to find two consecutive verses in which the two MSS. differ,
the one from the other, than two consecutive verses in which they
entirely agree</emph>? Now this is a plain matter of fact, of which
any one who pleases may easily convince himself. But the
character of two witnesses who habitually contradict one
another has been accounted, in every age, precarious. On
every such occasion, only one of them can possibly be speaking
the truth. Shall I be thought unreasonable if I confess
that these <emph>perpetual</emph> inconsistencies between Codd. B
and א,&mdash;grave inconsistencies, and occasionally even gross
ones,&mdash;altogether destroy my confidence in either?
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) On the other hand, discrepant as the testimony of
these two MSS. is throughout, they yet, strange to say,
conspire every here and there in exhibiting minute corruptions
of such an unique and peculiar kind as to betray
a (probably not very remote) common corrupt original.
These coincidences in fact are so numerous and so extraordinary
as to establish a real connexion between those two
codices; and that connexion is fatal to any claim which
might be set up on their behalf as wholly independent
witnesses.<note place="foot">e.g. S. Matth. x. 25; xii. 24, 27: S. Luke xi. 15, 18, 19
(βεεζεβουλ).&mdash;1 Cor. xiii. 3 (καυχησωμαι).&mdash;S. James i. 17
(αποσκιασματος).&mdash;Acts i. 5 (εν πν. βαπ. αγ.).&mdash;S. Mark vi. 20

</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Further, it is evident that both alike have been subjected,
probably during the process of transcription, to the
same depraving influences. But because such statements
require to be established by an induction of instances, the
reader's attention must now be invited to a few samples of
the grave blemishes which disfigure our two oldest copies
of the Gospel.
</p>

<p>
1. And first, since it is the omission of the end of S. Mark's
Gospel which has given rise to the present discussion, it
becomes a highly significant circumstance that the original
<pb n="079"/><anchor id="Pg079"/>
scribe of Cod. א had <emph>also</emph> omitted the <emph>end of the Gospel according
to S. John</emph>.<note place="foot">See Tischendorf's note in his reprint of the
Cod. Sin., <hi rend='italic'>Prolegg.</hi> p. lix.</note>
In this suppression of ver. 25, Cod. א stands
<emph>alone</emph> among MSS. A cloud of primitive witnesses vouch
for the genuineness of the verse. Surely, it is nothing else
but the <hi rend='italic'>reductio ad absurdum</hi> of a theory of recension, (with
Tischendorf in his last edition,) to accommodate our printed
text to the vicious standard of the original penman of Cod. א
and bring the last chapter of S. John's Gospel to a close
at ver. 24!
</p>

<p>
Cod. B, on the other hand, omits the whole of those two
solemn verses wherein S. Luke describes our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s <q>Agony
and bloody Sweat,</q> together with the act of the ministering
Angel.<note place="foot">Ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῷ ἄγγελος&mdash;καταβαίνοντα
ἐπὶ τὴν γῆν. S. Luke xxii. 43, 44.</note> As to the genuineness of those verses,
recognised as they are by Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Hippolytus, Epiphanius,
Didymus, Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom, Theodoret,
by all the oldest versions, and by almost every MS.
in existence, including Cod. א,&mdash;it admits of <emph>no</emph> doubt. Here
then is proof positive that in order to account for omissions
from the Gospel in the oldest of the uncials, there is no need
whatever to resort to the hypothesis that such portions of
the Gospel are not the genuine work of the Evangelist.
<q>The admitted error of Cod. B in this place,</q> (to quote the
words of Scrivener,) <q>ought to make some of its advocates
more chary of their confidence in cases where it is less
countenanced by other witnesses than in the instance before
us.</q>
</p>

<p>
Cod. B (not Cod. א) is further guilty of the <q>grave error</q>
(as Dean Alford justly styles it,) of omitting that solemn
record of the Evangelist:&mdash;<q>Then said <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>,
Father, forgive them; for they know not what they do.</q> It also withholds
the statement that the inscription on the Cross was
<q>in letters of Greek, and Latin, and Hebrew.</q><note place="foot">ὁ δὲ
Ἰησοῦς&mdash;τί ποιοῦσι, (xxiii. 34):&mdash;γράμμασιν Ἐλληνικοῖς καὶ
Ῥωμαῖκοῖς καὶ Ἐβραῖκοῖς, (xxiii. 38.) </note> Cod. א, on
the other hand, omits the confession of the man born blind
(ὁ δὲ ἔφη, πιστεύω, κύριε; καὶ προσεκύνησεν αὐτῷ) in S. John
ix. 38.&mdash;Both Cod. א and Cod. B retain nothing but the
<pb n="080"/><anchor id="Pg080"/>
word υἱόν of the expression τὸν υἱὸν αὐτῆς τὸν πρωτότοκον,
in S. Matth. i. 25; and suppress altogether the important
doctrinal statement ὁ ὠν ἐν τῷ οὐρανῷ, in S. John iii. 13:
as well as the clause διελθὼν διὰ μέσου αὐτῶν; καὶ παρῆγεν
οὕτως, in S. John viii. 59. Concerning all of which, let it
be observed that I am neither imputing motives nor pretending
to explain <emph>the design</emph> with which these several serious
omissions were made. All that is asserted is, that they cannot
be imputed to the carelessness of a copyist, but were
intentional: and I insist that they effectually dispose of the
presumption that when an important passage is observed to
be wanting from Cod. B or Cod. א, its absence is to be accounted
for by assuming that it was also absent <emph>from the
inspired autograph of the Evangelist</emph>.
</p>

<p>
2. To the foregoing must be added the many places where
the text of B or of א, or of both, has clearly been <emph>interpolated</emph>.
There does not exist in the whole compass of the New Testament
a more monstrous instance of this than is furnished
by the transfer of the incident of the piercing of our Redeemer's
side from S. John xix. 24 to S. Matth. xxvii., in
Cod. B and Cod. א, where it is introduced at the end of
ver. 49,&mdash;in defiance of reason as well as of
authority.<note place="foot">αλλος δε λαβων λογχην ενυξεν αυτου την πλευραν,
και εξηλθεν υδωρ και αιμα. Yet B, C, L and א contain this!</note>
<q>This interpolation</q> (remarks Mr. Scrivener) <q>which would
represent the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> as pierced while yet living, is a good
example of the fact that some of our highest authorities
may combine in attesting a reading unquestionably
false.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Coll. of the Cod. Sin.</hi>, p.
xlvii.</note> Another singularly gross specimen of interpolation, in my
judgment, is supplied by the purely apocryphal statement
which is met with in Cod. א, at the end of S. Matthew's account
of the healing of the Centurion's servant,&mdash;και υποστρεψας ο
εκατονταρχος εις τον οικον αυτου εν αυτη τη ωρα,
ευρεν τον παιδα υγιαινοντα (viii. 13.)&mdash;Nor can anything
well be weaker than the substitution (for ὑστερήσαντος οἴνου,
in S. John ii. 3) of the following,<note place="foot">So, in the margin of the
Hharklensian revision.</note> which is found <emph>only</emph> in
Cod. א:&mdash;οινον ουκ ειχον, οτι συνετελεσθε ο οινος του γαμου.
</p>

<pb n="081"/><anchor id="Pg081"/>

<p>
But the inspired text has been depraved in the same
licentious way throughout, by the responsible authors of
Cod. B and Cod. א, although such corruptions have attracted
little notice from their comparative unimportance. Thus,
the reading (in א) ημας δει εργαζεσθαι τα εργα του πεμψαντος
ημας (S. John ix. 4) carries with it its own sufficient
condemnation; being scarcely rendered more tolerable by
B's substitution of με for the second ημας.&mdash;Instead of τεθεμελίωτο
γὰρ ἐπὶ τὴν πέτραν (S. Luke vi. 48), B and א present
us with the insipid gloss, δια το καλως οικοδομεισθαι
αυτην.&mdash;In the last-named codex, we find the name of
<q>Isaiah</q> (ησαιου) thrust into S. Matth. xiii. 35, in defiance
of authority and of <hi rend='bold'>fact</hi>.&mdash;Can I be wrong in asserting that
the reading ο μονογενης θεος (for υἱός) in S. John i. 18,
(a reading found in Cod. B and Cod. א alike,) is undeserving
of serious attention?&mdash;May it not also be confidently declared
that, in the face of all MS. evidence,<note place="foot">Note, that it is a mistake for
the advocates of this reading to claim the <emph>Latin</emph> versions as allies.
Ἀπεκρίθη ἐκεῖνος, Ἄνθρωπος λεγόμενος Ἰησοῦς κ.τ.λ.
is not <q>Respondit, Ille homo qui dicitur Jesus,</q> (as both Tischendorf and
Tregelles assume;) but <q><emph>Respondit ille</emph>, Homo,</q> &amp;c.,&mdash;as in
verses 25 and 36.</note> no future
Editors of the New Testament will be found to accept the
highly improbable reading ο ανθρωπος ο λεγομενος Ιησους,
in S. John ix. 11, although the same two Codices conspire
in exhibiting it?&mdash;or, on the authority of one of them (א),
to read εν αυτῳ ζωη εστιν<note place="foot">This reading will be found
discussed in a footnote (p) at the end of <ref target="Chapter_VII">Chap.
VII</ref>.,&mdash;p. <ref target="Pg110">110</ref>.</note> (for ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἣν) in S.
John i. 4?&mdash;Certain at least it is that no one will <emph>ever</emph> be found
to read (with B) εβδομηκοντα δϙο in S. Luke x. 1,&mdash;or
(with א) ο εκλεκτος του θεου (instead of ὁ υἱὸς τοῦ θεοῦ) in
S. John i. 34.&mdash;But let me ask, With what show of reason
can the pretence of <emph>Infallibility</emph>, (as well as the plea of
Primacy), be set up on behalf of a pair of MSS. licentiously
corrupt as these have already been <emph>proved</emph> to be? For the
readings above enumerated, be it observed, are either critical
depravations of the inspired Text, or else unwarrantable
interpolations. They <emph>cannot</emph> have resulted from careless
transcription.
</p>

<p>
3. Not a few of the foregoing instances are in fact of a kind
<pb n="082"/><anchor id="Pg082"/>
to convince me that the text with which Cod. B and Cod. א
were chiefly acquainted, must have been once and again
subjected to a clumsy process of <emph>revision</emph>. Not unfrequently,
as may be imagined, the result (however tasteless and infelicitous)
is not of serious importance; as when, (to give
examples from Cod. א,) for τὸν ὄχλον ἐπικεῖσθαι αὐτῷ (in
S. Luke v. 1) we are presented with συναχθηναι τον οχλον:&mdash;when
for ζῶν ἀσώτως (in S. Luke xv. 13) we read εις χωραν
μακραν; and for οἱ ἐξουσιάζοντες αὐτῶν (in S. Luke xxii. 25),
we find οι αρχοντες των [εθνων] εξουσιαζουσιν αυτων, και,
(which is only a weak reproduction of S. Matth. xx. 25):&mdash;when
again, for σκοτία ἤδη ἐγεγόνει (in S. John vi. 17), we
are shewn καταλαβεν δε αυτους η σκοτια: and when, for
καὶ τίς ἐστιν ὁ παραδώσων αὐτόν (in S. John vi. 64) we are
invited to accept και τις ην ο μελλων αυτον παραδιδοναι.<note place="foot">The
following may be added from Cod. א:&mdash;μεγάλοι αὐτῶν (in S. Mark x.
42) changed into βασιλεις: ειπεν (in S. Mark xiv. 58) substituted for ἡμεῖς
ἠκούσαμεν αὐτου λέγοντος: εβδομηκοντα τεσσαρων (in S. Lu. ii. 37) for ὀγδοηκ:
and εωρακεν σε (in S. Jo. viii. 57) for ἑώρακας:&mdash;in all which four readings
Cod. א is without support. [Scrivener, <hi rend='italic'>Coll. Cod. Sin.</hi> p. li.]
The epithet μεγαν, introduced (in the same codex) before λίθον in S. Mark xv. 46; and και
πατριας inserted into the phrase ἐξ οἴκου Δαβίδ in S. Lu. i. 27,&mdash;are two more
specimens of mistaken officiousness. In the same infelicitous spirit, Cod. B
and Cod. א concur in omitting ἰσχυρόν (S. Matt. xiv. 30), and in substituting
πυκνα for πυγμῇ, and ραντισωνται for βαπτίσωνται in S. Mark vii. 3 and 4:&mdash;while
the interpolation of τασσομενος after ἐξουσίαν in S. Matth. viii. 9, because
of the parallel place in S. Luke's Gospel; and the substitution of ανθρωπος
αυστηρος ει (from S. Luke xix. 21) for σκληρὸς εἶ ἄνθρωπος in S. Matth. xxv. 24,
are proofs that yet another kind of corrupting influence has been here at work
besides those which have been already specified.</note>
But it requires very little acquaintance with the subject to
foresee that this kind of license may easily assume serious
dimensions, and grow into an intolerable evil. Thus, when
the man born blind is asked by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Holy One</hi> if he believes
ἐπὶ τὸν υἱὸν τοῦ Θεοῦ (S. John. ix. 35), we are by no means
willing to acquiesce in the proposed substitute, τον υιον του
ανθρωπου: neither, when the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> says, γινώσκομαι ὑπὸ
τῶν ἐμων (S. John x. 14) are we at all willing to put up
with the weak equivalent γινωσκουσι με τα εμα. Still less is
και εμοι αυτους εδωκασ any equivalent at all for καὶ τὰ ἐμὰ
πάντα σά ἐστι, καὶ τὰ σὰ ἐμά in S. John xvii. 10: or, αλλοι
<pb n="083"/><anchor id="Pg083"/>
ζωσουσιν σε, και ποιησουσιν σοι οσα ου θελεις, for ἄλλος σε
ζώσει; καὶ οὄσει ὅπου οὐ θέλεις, in S. John xxi. 18. Indeed,
even when our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> is not the speaker, such licentious
depravation of the text is not to be endured. Thus, in
S. Luke xxiii. 15, Cod. B and Cod. א conspire in substituting
for ἀνέπεμψα γὰρ ὑμᾶς πρὸς αὐτόν,&mdash;ανεπεμψεν γαρ αυτον
προς ημας; which leads one to suspect the copyist was
misled by the narrative in ver. 7. Similar instances might
be multiplied to an indefinite extent.
</p>

<p>
Two yet graver corruptions of the truth of the Gospel,
(but they belong to the same category,) remain to be specified.
Mindful, I suppose, of S. James' explanation <q>how
that <emph>by works</emph> a man is justified,</q> the author of the text of
Codices B and א has ventured to alter our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s assertion
(in S. Matth. xi. 19,) <q>Wisdom is justified of <emph>her children</emph>,</q>
into <q>Wisdom is justified by <emph>her works</emph>;</q> and, in the case
of Cod. א, his zeal is observed to have so entirely carried
him away, that he has actually substituted εργων for τέκνων
in the parallel place of S. Luke's Gospel.&mdash;The other example
of error (S. Matth. xxi. 31) is calculated to provoke
a smile. Finding that our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>, in describing the conduct
of the two sons in the parable, says of the one,&mdash;ὕστερον
δὲ μεταμεληθεὶς ἀπῆλθεν, and of the other,&mdash;καὶ
οὐκ ἀπῆλθεν; some ancient scribe, (who can have been but
slenderly acquainted with the Greek language,) seems to
have conceived the notion that a more precise way of identifying
the son who <q><emph>afterwards</emph> repented and went,</q> would
be to designate him as ὁ ὕστερος. Accordingly, in reply to
the question,&mdash;τίς ἐκ τῶν δύο ἐποίησεν τὸ θέλημα τοῦ πατρός;
we are presented (but <emph>only in Cod.</emph> B) with the astonishing
information,&mdash;λεγουσιν ο υστερος. And yet, seeing
clearly that this made nonsense of the parable, some
subsequent critic is found to have <emph>transposed the order of the
two sons</emph>: and in that queer condition the parable comes
down to us in the famous Vatican Codex B.
</p>

<p>
4. Some of the foregoing instances of infelicitous tampering
with the text of the Gospels are, it must be confessed,
very serious. But it is a yet more fatal circumstance in
connexion with Cod. B and Cod. א that they are convicted
<pb n="084"/><anchor id="Pg084"/>
of certain perversions of the truth of Scripture which <emph>must</emph>
have been made with deliberation and purpose. Thus, in
S. Mark xiv, they exhibit a set of passages&mdash;(verses 30, 68,
72)&mdash;<q>which bear clear marks of wilful and critical correction,
thoroughly carried out in Cod. א, only partially in Cod. B;
the object being so far to assimilate the narrative of Peter's
denial with those of the other Evangelists, as to suppress
the fact, vouched for by S. Mark only, that the cock crowed
<emph>twice</emph>. (In Cod. א, δίς is omitted in ver. 30,<q>&mdash;ἐκ δευτέρου
and δίς in ver. 72,&mdash;</q>and καὶ ἀλέκτωρ ἐφώνησε in ver. 68:
the last change being countenanced by B.)</q><note place="foot">Scrivener,
<hi rend='italic'>Coll. Cod. Sin.</hi> p. xlvii.</note> One such
discovery, I take leave to point out, is enough to destroy
all confidence in the text of these two manuscripts: for it
proves that another kind of corrupting influence,&mdash;besides
carelessness, and accident, and tasteless presumption, and
unskilful assiduity,&mdash;has been at work on Codices B and א.
We are constrained to approach these two manuscripts with
suspicion in all cases where a supposed critical difficulty in
harmonizing the statements of the several Evangelists will
account for any of the peculiar readings which they exhibit.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, it does not at all surprise me to discover
that in both Codices the important word ἐξελθοῦσαι (in
S. Matth. xxviii. 8) has been altered into απελθουσαι. I
recognise in that substitution of απο for ἔξ the hand of one
who was not aware that the women, when addressed by the
Angel, were <emph>inside the sepulchre</emph>; but who accepted the belief
(it is found to have been as common in ancient as in
modern times) that they beheld him <q>sitting on the
stone.</q><note place="foot">Add to the authorities commonly appealed to for
ἐξελθ. Chrys.^834 (twice,) (also quoted in Cramer's <hi rend='italic'>Cat.</hi> 241).
The mistake adverted to in the text is at least as old as the time of Eusebius,
(Mai, iv. p. 264 = 287), who asks,&mdash;Πῶς παρά τῷ Ματθάιῳ ἡ Μαγδαληνὴ Μαρία
μετὰ τῆς ἄλλης Μαρίας ἔξω τοῦ μνήματος ἑώρακεν τὸν ἕνα ἄγγελον ἐπικαθήμενον τῷ
λίθῳ τοῦ μνήματος, κ.τ.λ.</note>&mdash;In
consequence of a similar misconception, both Codices
are observed to present us with the word <q><emph>wine</emph></q> instead of
<q><emph>vinegar</emph></q> in S. Matthew's phrase ὄξος μετὰ χολῆς μεμνγμένον:
which results from a mistaken endeavour on the
part of some ancient critic to bring S. Matth. xxvii. 34 into
<pb n="085"/><anchor id="Pg085"/>
harmony with S. Mark xv. 23. The man did not perceive
that the cruel insult of the <q>vinegar and gall</q> (which the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> tasted but would not drink) was quite a distinct
thing from the proffered mercy of the <q>myrrhed wine</q>
which the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> put away from Himself altogether.
</p>

<p>
So again, it was in order to bring S. Luke xxiv. 13 into
harmony with a supposed fact of geography that Cod. א
states that Emmaus, (which Josephus also places at sixty
stadia from Jerusalem), was <q><emph>an hundred</emph> and sixty</q> stadia
distant. The history of this interpolation of the text is
known. It is because some ancient critic (Origen probably)
erroneously assumed that <emph>Nicopolis</emph> was the place intended.
The conjecture met with favour, and there are not wanting
scholia to declare that this was the reading of <q>the accurate</q>
copies,&mdash;notwithstanding the physical impossibility
which is involved by the statement.<note place="foot">Tischendorf accordingly
<emph>is forced</emph>, for once, to reject the reading of his
oracle א,&mdash;witnessed to though it be by Origen and Eusebius. His discussion
of the text in this place is instructive and even diverting. How is it that such
an instance as the present does not open the eyes of Prejudice itself to the
danger of pinning its faith to the consentient testimony even of Origen, of
Eusebius, and of Cod. א?... The reader is reminded of what was offered
above, in the lower part of p. <ref target="Pg049">49</ref>.</note>&mdash;Another
geographical misconception under which the scribe of Cod. א is found to
have laboured was that Nazareth (S. Luke i. 26) and Capernaum
(S. Mark i. 28) were <emph>in Judæa</emph>. Accordingly he has
altered the text in both the places referred to, to suit his
private notion.<note place="foot">A similar perversion of the truth of Scripture
is found at S. Luke iv. 44, (cf. the parallel place, S. Matth. iv. 23: S. Mark i. 89).
It does not mend the matter to find א supported this time by Codd. B, C, L, Q,
R.</note>&mdash;A yet more striking specimen of the preposterous
method of the same scribe is supplied by his substitution
of Καισαριας for Σαμαρείας in Acts viii. 5,&mdash;evidently
misled by what he found in viii. 40 and xxi. 8.&mdash;Again,
it must have been with a view of bringing Revelation
into harmony with the (supposed) facts of physical
Science that for the highly significant Theological record
καὶ ἐσκοτίσθη ὁ ἥλιος at the Crucifixion,<note place="foot">S. Lu. xxiii.
45:&mdash;ὅπερ οὐδέποτε πρότερον συνέβη, ἀλλ᾽ ἢ ἐν Αἰγύπτω μόνον,
ὅτε τὸ πάσχα τελεῖσθαι ἔμελλε; καὶ γὰρ ἐκεῖνα τούτων τύπος ἦν.
(Chrys. vii. 824 c.)</note> has been substituted
both in B and א, του ηλιου εκλιποντος,&mdash;a statement
<pb n="086"/><anchor id="Pg086"/>
which (as the ancients were perfectly well aware<note place="foot">ὅπως δὲ μὴ εἰπωσί
τινες ἔκλειψιν εἶναι τὸ γεγενημένον, ἐν τῇ τεσσαρεσκαιδεκάτη
ἡμέρᾳ τῆς σελήνης γἐγονε τὸ σκότος:&mdash;ὅτε ἔκλειψιν συμβῆναι ἀμήχανον.
So Victor of Antioch, in his Catena on S. Mark (ed. Possin.) He makes the
remark twice: first (p. 351) in the midst of an abridgment of the beginning of
Chrysostom's 88th Homily on S. Matthew: next (p. 352) more fully, after quoting
<q>the great Dionysius</q> of Alexandria. See also an interesting passage on
the same subject in Cramer's <hi rend='italic'>Catena in Matth.</hi> i. p.
237,&mdash;from whom derived, I know not; but professing to be from Chrysostom.
(Note, that the 10 lines ἐξ ἀνεπιγράφου, beginning p. 236, line 33 = Chrys. vii. 824,
D, E.) The very next words in Chrysostom's published Homily (p. 825 A.) are as
follows:&mdash;Ὅτε γὰρ οὐκ ἦν ἔκλειψις, αλλ᾽ ὀργή τε καὶ ἀγανάκτησις, οὐκ ἐντεῦθεν
μόνον δῆλον ἦν, ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀπὸ τοῦ καιροῦ; τρεῖς γἀρ ὥρας παρέμεινεν, ἡ δὲ ἔκλειψις
ἐν μιᾷ γίνεται καιροῦ ῥοπῇ.&mdash;Anyone who would investigate this matter further
should by all means read Matthaei's long note on S. Luke xxiii. 45.</note>)
introduces into the narrative an astronomical contradiction.&mdash;It
may be worth adding, that Tischendorf with singular
inconsistency admits into his text the astronomical contradiction,
while he rejects the geographical impossibility.&mdash;And
this may suffice concerning the text of Codices B
and א.
</p>

<p>
III. We are by this time in a condition to form a truer
estimate of the value of the testimony borne by these two
manuscripts in respect of the last twelve verses of S. Mark's
Gospel. If we were disposed before to regard their omission
of an important passage as a serious matter, we certainly
cannot any longer so regard it. We have by this time seen
enough to disabuse our minds of every prejudice. Codd. B
and א are the very reverse of infallible guides. Their deflections
from the Truth of Scripture are more constant, as
well as more licentious by far, than those of their younger
brethren: their unauthorized omissions from the sacred text
are not only far more frequent but far more flagrant also.
And yet the main matter before us,&mdash;<emph>their omission of the last
twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel</emph>,&mdash;when rightly understood,
proves to be an entirely different phenomenon from what an
ordinary reader might have been led to suppose. Attention
is specially requested for the remarks which follow.
</p>

<p>
IV. To say that in the Vatican Codex (B), which is unquestionably
the oldest we possess, S. Mark's Gospel ends
abruptly at the 8th verse of the xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
chapter, and that the
<pb n="087"/><anchor id="Pg087"/>
customary subscription (ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ) follows,&mdash;is true; but
it is far from being <emph>the whole</emph> truth. It requires to be stated
in addition that the scribe, whose plan is found to have been
to begin every fresh book of the Bible at the top of <emph>the next
ensuing column</emph> to that which contained the concluding words
of the preceding book, has at the close of S. Mark's Gospel
deviated from his else invariable practice. He has left in
this place one column entirely vacant. It is <emph>the only vacant
column</emph> in the whole manuscript;&mdash;a blank space <emph>abundantly
sufficient to contain the twelve verses which he nevertheless withheld.
Why</emph> did he leave that column vacant? <emph>What</emph> can have
induced the scribe on this solitary occasion to depart from
his established rule? The phenomenon,&mdash;(I believe I was the
first to call distinct attention to it,)&mdash;is in the highest degree
significant, and admits of only one interpretation. <emph>The
older MS.</emph> from which Cod. B was copied must have infallibly
<emph>contained</emph> the twelve verses in dispute. The copyist was instructed
to leave them out,&mdash;and he obeyed: but he prudently
left a blank space <hi rend='italic'>in memoriam rei</hi>. Never was blank
more intelligible! Never was silence more eloquent! By
this simple expedient, strange to relate, the Vatican Codex
is made to <emph>refute itself</emph> even while it seems to be bearing testimony
against the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel,
by withholding them: for it forbids the inference which,
under ordinary circumstances, must have been drawn from
that omission. It does more. By <emph>leaving room</emph> for the
verses it omits, it brings into prominent notice at the end of
fifteen centuries and a half, <emph>a more ancient witness than itself</emph>.
The venerable Author of the original Codex from which
Codex B was copied, is thereby brought to view. And thus,
our supposed adversary (Codex B) proves our most useful
ally: for it procures us the testimony of an hitherto unsuspected
witness. The earlier scribe, I repeat, unmistakably
comes forward at this stage of the inquiry, to explain that
<emph>he</emph> at least is prepared to answer for the genuineness of these
Twelve concluding Verses with which the later scribe, his
copyist, from his omission of them, might unhappily be
thought to have been unacquainted.
</p>

<p>
It will be perceived that nothing is gained by suggesting
<pb n="088"/><anchor id="Pg088"/>
that the scribe of Cod. B. <emph>may</emph> have copied from a MS. which
exhibited the same phenomenon which he has himself reproduced.
This, by shifting the question a little further
back, does but make the case against Cod. א the stronger.
</p>

<p>
But in truth, after the revelation which has been already
elicited from Cod. B, the evidence of Cod. א may be very
summarily disposed of. I have already, on independent
grounds, ventured to assign to that Codex a somewhat later
date than is claimed for the Codex Vaticanus.<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg070">70</ref>, and the <ref target="Appendix_F">Appendix
(F)</ref>.</note> My opinion
is confirmed by observing that the Sinaitic contains no such
blank space at the end of S. Mark's Gospel as is conspicuous
in the Vatican Codex. I infer that the Sinaitic was copied
from a Codex which had been already mutilated, and reduced
to the condition of Cod. B; and that the scribe, only
because he knew not what it meant, exhibited S. Mark's
Gospel in consequence as if it really had no claim to those
twelve concluding verses which, nevertheless, <emph>every</emph> authority
we have hitherto met with has affirmed to belong to it
of right.
</p>

<p>
Whatever may be thought of the foregoing suggestion,
it is at least undeniable that Cod. B and Cod. א are at variance
on the main point. They <emph>contradict</emph> one another concerning
the twelve concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel. For
while Cod. א refuses to know anything at all about those
verses, Cod. B admits that it remembers them well, by volunteering
the statement that they were found in the older
codex, of which it is in every other respect a faithful representative.
The older and the better manuscript (B), therefore,
refutes its junior (א). And it will be seen that logically
this brings the inquiry to a close, as far as the evidence of
the manuscripts is concerned. We have referred to the
oldest extant copy of the Gospels in order to obtain its testimony:
and,&mdash;<q>Though without the Twelve Verses concerning
which you are so solicitous,</q> (it seems to say,) <q>I yet
hesitate not to confess to you that an older copy than myself,&mdash;the
ancient Codex from which I was copied,&mdash;actually did
contain them.</q>
</p>

<p>
The problem may, in fact, be briefly stated as follows. Of
<pb n="089"/><anchor id="Pg089"/>
the four oldest Codices of the Gospels extant,&mdash;B, א, A, C,&mdash;two
(B and א) are <emph>without</emph> these twelve verses: two (A and C)
are <emph>with</emph> them. Are these twelve verses then an unauthorized
<emph>addition</emph> to A and C? or are they an unwarrantable
<emph>omission</emph> from B and א? B itself declares plainly that from
itself they are an omission. And B is the oldest Codex of
the Gospel in existence. What candid mind will persist in
clinging to the solitary fact that from the single Codex א
these verses are away, in proof that <q>S. Mark's Gospel was
at first without the verses which at present conclude it?</q>
</p>

<p>
Let others decide, therefore, whether the present discussion
has not already reached a stage at which an unprejudiced
Arbiter might be expected to address the prosecuting
parties somewhat to the following effect:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">This case must now be dismissed. The charge brought
by yourselves against these Verses was, that they are an unauthorized
addition to the second Gospel; a spurious appendix,
of which the Evangelist S. Mark can have known
nothing. But so far from substantiating this charge, you
have not adduced a single particle of evidence which renders
it even probable.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">The appeal was made by yourselves to Fathers and to
MSS. It has been accepted. And with what result?</q>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) <q rend="pre">Those many Fathers whom you represented as
hostile, prove on investigation to be reducible to <emph>one</emph>, viz. Eusebius:
and Eusebius, as we have seen, <emph>does not say</emph> that the
verses are spurious, but on the contrary labours hard to
prove that they may very well be genuine. On the other
hand, there are earlier Fathers than Eusebius who quote
them without any signs of misgiving. In this way, the
positive evidence in their favour is carried back to the
ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>
century.</q>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) <q rend="pre">Declining the testimony of the Versions, you
insisted on an appeal to MSS. On the MSS., in fact, you still make
your stand,&mdash;or rather you rely on <emph>the oldest</emph> of them; for,
(as you are aware,) <emph>every MS. in the world except the two
oldest</emph> are against you.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">I have therefore questioned the elder of those two MSS.;
and it has volunteered the avowal that an older MS. than
<pb n="090"/><anchor id="Pg090"/>
itself&mdash;<emph>the Codex from which it was copied</emph>&mdash;was furnished
with those very Verses which you wish me to believe that
some older MS. still must needs have been without. What
else can be said, then, of your method but that it is frivolous?
and of your charge, but that it is contradicted by
the evidence to which you yourselves appeal?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">But it is illogical; that is, it is unreasonable, besides.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">For it is high time to point out that even if it so happened
that the oldest known MS. was observed to be without
these twelve concluding verses, it would still remain a thing
unproved (not to say highly improbable) that from the autograph
of the Evangelist himself they were also away. Supposing,
further, that no Ecclesiastical writer of the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>
or iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century could be found who quoted them:
even so, it would not follow that there existed no such verses for a primitive
Father to quote. The earliest of the Versions might
in addition yield faltering testimony; but even so, <emph>who</emph> would
be so rash as to raise on such a slender basis the monstrous
hypothesis, that S. Mark's Gospel when it left the hands of
its inspired Author was without the verses which at present
conclude it? How, then, would you have proposed to account
for the consistent testimony of an opposite kind yielded
by every other known document in the world?</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>But, on the other hand, what are the facts of the case?
(1) The earliest of the Fathers,&mdash;(2) the most venerable of
the Versions,&mdash;(3) the oldest MS. of which we can obtain
any tidings,&mdash;<emph>all</emph> are observed to <emph>recognize these Verses</emph>.
<q>Cadit quaestio</q> therefore. The last shadow of pretext has
vanished for maintaining with Tischendorf that <q>Mark the
Evangelist knew nothing of</q> these verses:&mdash;with Tregelles
that <q>The book of Mark himself extends no further than
ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ:</q>&mdash;with Griesbach that <q>the <emph>last leaf of the
original Gospel was probably torn away</emph>.</q>... It is high time,
I say, that this case were dismissed. But there are also costs
to be paid. Cod. B and Cod. א are convicted of being <q>two
false witnesses,</q> and must be held to go forth from this inquiry
with an injured reputation.</q>
</p>

<p>
This entire subject is of so much importance that I must
needs yet awhile crave the reader's patience and attention.

<p>
The subject which exclusively occupied our attention
throughout the foregoing chapter admits of apt and powerful
illustration. Its vast importance will be a sufficient
apology for the particular disquisition which follows, and
might have been spared, but for the plain challenge of the
famous Critic to be named immediately.
</p>

<p>
<q>There are two remarkable readings,</q> (says Tischendorf,
addressing English readers on this subject in 1868,) <q>which
are very instructive towards determining the age of the
manuscripts [א and B], and <emph>their authority</emph>.</q> He proceeds
to adduce,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. The absence from both, of the last Twelve Verses of
S. Mark's Gospel,&mdash;concerning which, the reader probably
thinks that by this time he has heard enough. Next,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
2. He appeals to their omission of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ
from the first verse of S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians,&mdash;<emph>another
peculiarity, in which Codd.</emph> א <emph>and B stand quite alone
among MSS.</emph>
</p>

<p>
I. Here is an extraordinary note of sympathy between
two copies of the New Testament indeed. Altogether unique
is it: and that it powerfully corroborates the general opinion
<pb n="092"/><anchor id="Pg092"/>
of their high antiquity, no one will deny. But how about
<q>their <emph>authority</emph></q>? Does the coincidence also raise our
opinion of <emph>the trustworthiness of the Text</emph>, which these two
MSS. concur in exhibiting? for <emph>that</emph> is the question which
has to be considered,&mdash;the <emph>only</emph> question. The ancientness of
a reading is one thing: its genuineness, (as I have explained
elsewhere,) quite another. The questions are entirely distinct.
It may even be added that while the one is really of
little moment, the latter is of all the importance in the
world. I am saying that it matters very little whether
Codd. א and B were written in the beginning of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, or in the beginning of the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>: whereas it matters
much, or rather it matters <emph>everything</emph>, whether they exhibit
the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> faithfully, or occasionally with scandalous
license. How far the reading which results from the suppression
of the last two words in the phrase τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς
οὖσιν ἐν Ἐφέσῳ, is <emph>critically allowable</emph> or not, I forbear to
inquire. That is not the point which we have to determine.
The one question to be considered is,&mdash;May it <emph>possibly</emph> be
the true reading of the text after all? Is it any way
<emph>credible</emph> that S. Paul began his Epistle to the Ephesians as
follows:&mdash;Παῦλος ἀπόστολος Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ διὰ θελήματος
Θεοῦ, τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς οὖσι καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ?...
If it be eagerly declared in reply that the thing is simply
incredible: that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ are required for the
sense; and that the commonly received reading is no doubt
the correct one: then,&mdash;there is an end of the discussion.
Two extraordinary notes of sympathy between two Manuscripts
will have been appealed to as crucial proofs of the
<emph>trustworthiness of the Text</emph> of those Manuscripts: (for of their
high <emph>Antiquity</emph>, let me say it once more, there can be no
question whatever:) and it will have been proved in one
case,&mdash;admitted in the other,&mdash;that <emph>the omission is
unwarrantable</emph>.&mdash;If, however, on the contrary, it be maintained that
the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ probably had no place in the original
copy of this Epistle, but are to be regarded as an unauthorized
addition to it,&mdash;then, (as in the case of the Twelve Verses
omitted from the end of S. Mark's Gospel, and which it was
<emph>also</emph> pretended are an unauthorized supplement,) we demand
<pb n="093"/><anchor id="Pg093"/>
to be shewn the evidence on the strength of which this
opinion is maintained, in order that we may ascertain what
it is precisely worth.
</p>

<p>
Tischendorf,&mdash;the illustrious discoverer and champion of
Codex א, and who is accustomed to appeal triumphantly to
its omission of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ as <emph>the other</emph> conclusive
proof of the trustworthiness of its text,&mdash;may be presumed to
be the most able advocate it is likely to meet with, as well
as the man best acquainted with what is to be urged in its
support. From him, we learn that the evidence for the
omission of the words in question is as follows:&mdash;<q>In the
beginning of the Epistle to the Ephesians we read, <q>to the
saints which are at Ephesus;</q> but Marcion (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 130-140),
did not find the words <q>at Ephesus</q> in his copy. The same
is true of Origen (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 185-254); and Basil the Great
(who died <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 379), affirmed that those words were wanting
in <emph>old</emph> copies. And this omission accords very well with
the encyclical or general character of the Epistle. At the
present day, our ancient Greek MSS., and all ancient Versions,
contain the words <q>at Ephesus;</q> yea (<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>), even Jerome
knew no copy with a different reading. Now, only the
Sinaitic and the Vatican correspond with the <emph>old</emph> copies of
Basil, and those of Origen and Marcion.</q><note place="foot">Tischendorf's
<q><hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi></q> to his (Tauchnitz) edition of the English
N.T., 1869,&mdash;p. xiii.</note>&mdash;This then is
the sum of the evidence. Proceed we to examine it somewhat
in detail.
</p>

<p>
(1) And first, I take leave to point out that the learned
writer is absolutely without authority for his assertion that
<q>Marcion <emph>did not find</emph> the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in his copy</q> of
S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. Tischendorf's one pretence
for saying so is Tertullian's statement that certain
heretics, (Marcion he specifies by name,) had given to
S. Paul's <q>Epistle to the Ephesians</q> the unauthorized title
of <q>Epistle <emph>to the Laodiceans</emph>.</q><note place="foot"><q>Epistola quam
nos <q>ad Ephesios</q> præscriptam habemus, hæretici vero 'ad Laodicenos.</q>
<hi rend='italic'>Adv. Marcion.</hi> lib. v. c. xi, p. 309 (ed. Oehler.)</note> This,
(argues Tischendorf,) Marcion could not have done had he found ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in the
first verse.<note place="foot"><q><q>Titulum</q> enim <q><emph>ad Laodicenos</emph></q>
ut addidisse accusatur a Tertulliano, ita in salutatione verba ἐν Ἐφέσῳ

But the proposed inference is clearly invalid.
<pb n="094"/><anchor id="Pg094"/>
For, with what show of reason can Marcion,&mdash;whom Tertullian
taxes with having dared <q><hi rend='italic'>titulum interpolare</hi></q> in the
case of S. Paul's <q>Epistle to the Ephesians,</q>&mdash;be <emph>therefore</emph>,
assumed to have read the first verse differently from ourselves?
Rather is the directly opposite inference suggested
by the very language in which Tertullian (who
was all but the contemporary of Marcion) alludes to the
circumstance.<note place="foot"><q>Ecclesiæ quidem veritate Epistolam istam <q>ad
Ephesios</q> habemus emissam, non <q>ad Laodicenos;</q> sed Marcion ei titulum aliquando

</p>

<p>
Those, however, who would really understand the work
of the heretic, should turn from the African Father,&mdash;(who
after all does but say that Marcion and his crew feigned
concerning S. Paul's Epistle to the <emph>Ephesians</emph>, that it was
addressed to the <emph>Laodiceans</emph>,)&mdash;and betake themselves to the
pages of Epiphanius, who lived about a century and a half
later. This Father had for many years made Marcion's
work his special study,<note place="foot">ἀπὸ ἐτῶν ἰκανῶν. (Epiphan.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. 310 c.)</note> and has elaborately described it,
as well as presented us with copious extracts from it.<note place="foot"><p>He describes
its structure minutely at vol. i. pp. 309-310, and from pp. 312-7; 318-321.
[Note, by the way, the gross blunder which has crept into the printed text of
Epiphanius at p. 321 <hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>: pointed out long since by
Jones, <hi rend='italic'>On the Canon</hi>, ii. 38.] His plan is excellent. Marcion had
rejected every Gospel except S. Luke's, and of S. Paul's Epistles had retained only
ten,&mdash;viz. (1st) Galatians, (2nd and 3rd) I and II Corinthians, (4th) Romans,
(5th and 6th) I and II Thessalonians, (7th) <emph>Ephesians</emph>, (8th) Colossians,
(9th) Philemon, (10th) Philippians. Even these he had mutilated and depraved.
And yet out of that one mutilated Gospel, Epiphanius selects 78 passages,
(pp. 312-7), and out of those ten mutilated Epistles, 40 passages more (pp. 318-21);
by means of which 118 texts he undertakes to refute the heresy of
Marcion. (pp. 322-50: 350-74.) [It will be perceived that Tertullian goes
over Marcion's work in much the same way.] Very beautiful, and well worthy
of the student's attention, (though it comes before us in a somewhat incorrect
form,) is the remark of Epiphanius concerning the living energy of
<hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Word, even when dismembered and exhibited in a
fragmentary shape. <q>Ὅλου γὰρ τοῦ σώματος ζῶντος, ὡς εἰπεῖν, τῆς θείας γραφῆς, ποῖον
ηὕρισκε (sc. Marcion) μέλος νεκρὸν κατὰ τῆν αὐτοῦ γνώμην, ἵνα παρεισαγάγη ψεῦδος κατὰ
τῆς ἀληθείας; ... παρέκοψε πολλὰ τῶν μελῶν, κατέσχε δὲ ἔνιά τινα παρ᾽ ἑαυτῷ; καὶ αὐτὰ δὲ
τὰ κατασχεθέντα ἔτι ζῶντα οὐ δύναται νεκροῦσθαι, ἀλλ᾽ ἐκεῖ μὲν τὸ ζωτικὸν τῆς
ἐμφάσεως, κᾴν τε μυρίως παρ᾽ αὐτῷ κατὰ λεπτὸν ἀποτμηθείν.</q> (p. 375
<hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>.) He seems to say of Marcion,&mdash;
</p>
<lg>
<l>Fool! to suppose thy shallow wits</l>
<l rend='margin-left: 2'>Could quench a fire like that. Go, learn</l>
<l>That cut into ten thousand bits</l>

</note> And
<pb n="095"/><anchor id="Pg095"/>
the account in Epiphanius proves that Tischendorf is mistaken
in the statement which he addresses to the English
reader, (quoted above;) and that he would have better consulted
for his reputation if he had kept to the <q>ut videtur</q>
with which (in his edition of 1859) he originally broached
his opinion. It proves in fact to be no matter of opinion
at all. Epiphanius states distinctly that the <emph>Epistle to the
Ephesians</emph> was one of the ten Epistles of S. Paul which
Marcion <emph>retained</emph>. In his <q>Apostolicon,</q> or collection of
the (mutilated) Apostolical Epistles, the <q>Epistle to the
Ephesians,</q> (identified by the considerable quotations which
Epiphanius makes from it,<note place="foot">He quotes Ephes. ii. 11, 12, 13, 14:
v. 14: v. 31. (See Epiphanius, <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. p. 318 and 371-2.)
</note>) stood (he says) <emph>seventh</emph> in
order; while the (so called) <q>Epistle to the Laodiceans,</q>&mdash;a
distinct composition therefore,&mdash;had the <emph>eleventh</emph>, that is, the
last place assigned to it.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 318
<hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi> ( = 371 <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>), and
<hi rend="smallcaps"> 319 a ( = 374 a.)</hi></note> That this latter Epistle contained
a corrupt exhibition of Ephes. iv. 5 is true enough. Epiphanius
records the fact in two places.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 319
and 374. But note, that through error in the copies, or else
through inadvertence in the Editor, the depravation commented on at p. 374
<hi rend="smallcaps">b, c,</hi> is lost sight of at p. 319
<hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>.</note> But then it is to
be borne in mind that he charges Marcion with having
derived that quotation <emph>from the Apocryphal Epistle to the
Laodiceans</emph>;<note place="foot">See below, at the end of the next note.</note>
instead of taking it, as he ought to have done,
from the genuine Epistle to the Ephesians. The passage,
when faithfully exhibited, (as Epiphanius points out,) by
its very form refutes the heretical tenet which the context
of Marcion's spurious epistle to the Laodiceans was intended
to establish; and which the verse in question, in its interpolated
form, might seem to favour.<note place="foot"><p>Προσέθετο δὲ ἐν τῷ ἰδίῳ Ἀποστολικῷ
καλουμένῳ καὶ τῆς καλουμένης πρὸς Λαοδικέας:&mdash;<q>Εῖς Κύριος, μία πίστις, ἕν

ἐν πᾶσιν.</q> (Epiphan. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol i. p. 374.) Here is obviously
a hint of τριῶν ἀνάρχων ἀρχῶν διαφορὰς πρὸς ἀλλήλας ἐξουσῶν: [Μαρκίωνος γὰρ τοῦ
ματαιόφρονος δίδαγμα, εἰς τρεῖς ἀρχὰς τῆς μοναρχίας τομὴν καὶ διαίρεσιν. Athanas. i.

Ἀποστόλου ὑπόθεσις καὶ ἠσφαλισμένον κήρυγμα. ἀλλὰ ἄλλως παρὰ τὸ σὸν ποιήτευμα.

Epiphanius reproaches Marcion with having obtained materials ἐκτὸς τοῦ

πρὸς Ἐφεσίους ταύτην τὴν μαρτυρίαν λέγειν, (sc. the words quoted above,) ἀλλὰ
τῆς πρὸς Λαοδικέας, τῆς μὴ οὔσης ἐν τῷ Ἀποστόλῳ (p. 375 <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>.)
(Epiphanius here uses Ἀπόστολος in its technical sense,&mdash;viz. as synonymous with S.
Paul's Epistles.)</p></note>&mdash;I have entered into
<pb n="096"/><anchor id="Pg096"/>
this whole question more in detail perhaps than was necessary:
but I was determined to prove that Tischendorf's
statement that <q>Marcion (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 130-140) did not find the
words <q>at Ephesus</q> in his copy,</q>&mdash;is absolutely without
foundation. It is even <emph>contradicted</emph> by the known facts of
the case. I shall have something more to say about Marcion
by-and-by; who, it is quite certain, read the text of Ephes.
i. 1 exactly as we do.
</p>

<p>
(2.) The <emph>only</emph> Father who so expresses himself as to warrant
the inference that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ were absent
from his copy, is Origen, in the beginning of the third century.
<q>Only in the case of the Ephesians,</q> (he writes),
<q>do we meet with the expression <q>the Saints which are:</q>
and we inquire,&mdash;Unless that additional phrase be simply
redundant, what can it possibly signify? Consider, then,
whether those who have been partakers of <emph>His</emph> nature who
revealed Himself to Moses by the Name of I <hi rend="smallcaps">am</hi>, may not,
in consequence of such union with Him, be designated as
<q>those <emph>which are</emph>:</q> persons, called out, of a state of
<emph>not</emph>-being, so to speak, into a state of
<emph>being</emph>.</q><note place="foot"><q>Ὠριγένης δέ φησι,&mdash;</q>Ἐπὶ μόνων

i. 1,&mdash;vol. vi. p. 102.</note>&mdash;If Origen had
read τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς οὖσιν ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in his copy, it is
to me incredible that he would have gone so very far out
of his way to miss the sense of such a plain, and in fact,
<pb n="097"/><anchor id="Pg097"/>
unmistakable an expression. Bishop Middleton, and Michaelis
before him,&mdash;<emph>reasoning however only from the place in
Basil,</emph> (to be quoted immediately,)&mdash;are unwilling to allow
that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ were ever away from the text. It
must be admitted as the obvious inference from what Jerome
has delivered on this subject (<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg098">98</ref> <hi rend='italic'>note</hi>) that he, too,
seems to know nothing of the reading (if reading it can be
called) of Codd. B and א.
</p>

<p>
(3) The influence which Origen's writings exercised over
his own and the immediately succeeding ages of the Church,
was prodigious. Basil, bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia,
writing against the heresy of Eunomius about 150 years
later,&mdash;although he read ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in his own copy of
S. Paul's Epistles,&mdash;thought fit to avail himself of Origen's
suggestion. It suited his purpose. He was proving the
eternal existence of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.
Even <emph>not to know</emph> <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>
(he remarks) is <emph>not to be</emph>: in proof of which, he quotes
S. Paul's words in 1 Cor. i. 28:&mdash;<q>Things <emph>which are not</emph>,
hath <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> chosen.</q> <q>Nay,</q> (he proceeds,) the same S.
Paul, <q>in his Epistle to the Ephesians, inasmuch as he is addressing
persons who by intimate knowledge were truly joined
to Him who <q><hi rend="smallcaps">is</hi>,</q> designates them specially as <q>those
<emph>which are</emph>:</q> saying,&mdash;<q>To the Saints <emph>which are</emph>,
and faithful in <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ Jesus</hi>.</q></q> That this fancy was not
original, Basil makes no secret. He derived it, (he says,) from <q>those
who were before us;</q> a plain allusion to the writings of
Origen. But neither was <emph>the reading</emph> his own, either. This
is evident. He had <emph>found</emph> it, he says,&mdash;(an asseveration indispensable
to the validity of his argument,)&mdash;but only after
he had made search,<note place="foot">Consider S. John i. 42, 44, 46: v. 14: ix. 35:
xii. 14, &amp;c.</note>&mdash;<q><emph>in the old
copies</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Ἀλλὰ
καὶ τοῖς Ἐφεσίοις ἐπιστέλλων ὡς γνησίως ἡνωμένοις τῷ Ὄντι δι᾽ ἐπιγνώσεως,
<q>ὄντας</q> αὐτοὺς ἰδιαζόντως ὠνόμασεν, εἰπών: <q>τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς οὖσι,
καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ.</q> οὕτω γὰρ καὶ οἱ πρὸ ἡμῶν παραδεδώκασι, καὶ ἡμεῖς ἐν
τοῖς παλαιοῖς τῶν ἀντιγράφων εὑρήκαμεν. Note also what immediately follows.
(Basil <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. p. 254 E, 255 A.)</note> No doubt,
Origen's strange fancy must have been even <emph>unintelligible</emph> to
Basil when first he met with it. In plain terms, it sounds to
this day incredibly foolish,&mdash;when read apart from the mutilated
text which alone suggested it to Origen's fervid imagination.&mdash;But
<pb n="098"/><anchor id="Pg098"/>
what there is in all this to induce us to
suspect that Origen's reading was after all the <emph>right</emph> one,
and <emph>ours</emph> the <emph>wrong</emph>, I profess myself wholly at a loss to
discover. Origen himself complains bitterly of the depraved
state of the copies in his time; and attributes it (1) to the
carelessness of the scribes: (2) to the rashness of correctors
of the text: (3) to the licentiousness of individuals, adopting
some of these corrections and rejecting others, according
to their own private caprice.<note place="foot">See the places quoted by Scrivener,
<hi rend='italic'>Introd.</hi> pp. 381-91; particularly p. 385.</note>
</p>

<p>
(4) Jerome, a man of severer judgment in such matters
than either Origen or Basil, after rehearsing the preceding
gloss, (but only to reject it,) remarks that <q>certain persons</q>
had been <q>over-fanciful</q> in putting it forth. He alludes
probably to Origen, whose Commentary on the Ephesians,
in three books, he expressly relates that he employed:<note place="foot">Hieron.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. vii. p. 543:&mdash;<q>Illud quoque in Præfatione

quem et nos ex parte sequuti sumus.</q></note> but
he does not seem to have apprehended that Origen's text
<emph>was without the words</emph> ἐν Ἐφέσῳ. If he was acquainted with
Origen's text, (of which, however, his writings afford no indication,)
it is plain that he disapproved of it. Others, he says,
understand S. Paul to say not <q>the Saints <emph>which are</emph>:</q> but,&mdash;<q>the
Saints and faithful <emph>which are at Ephesus</emph>.</q><note place="foot"><q>Quidam

<p>
(5) The witnesses have now all been heard: and I submit
that there has been elicited from their united evidence nothing
at all calculated to shake our confidence in the universally
received reading of Ephesians i. 1. The facts of the
case are so scanty that they admit of being faithfully stated
in a single sentence. Two MSS. of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, (exhibiting in other respects several striking notes of vicious
sympathy,) are found to conspire in omitting a clause in
Ephesians i. 1, which, (necessary as it is to the sense,) may
be inferred to have been absent from Origen's copy: and
<pb n="099"/><anchor id="Pg099"/>
Basil testifies that it was absent from <q>the old copies</q> to
which he himself obtained access. This is really the whole
of the matter: in which it is much to be noted that Origen
does not say that he <emph>approved</emph> of this reading. Still less does
Basil. They both witness to <emph>the fact</emph> that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ
were omitted from <emph>some</emph> copies of the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century,
just as Codd. B and א witness to the same fact in the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>.
But what then? Origen is known occasionally to go out
of his way to notice readings confessedly worthless; and,
why not here? For not only is the text all but <emph>unintelligible</emph>
if the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ be omitted: but (what is
far more to the purpose) the direct evidence of <emph>all</emph> the copies,
whether uncial or cursive,<note place="foot">The cursive <q>Cod. No. 67</q> (or
<q>67<hi rend="vertical-align: super">2</hi></q>) is improperly quoted as <q>omitting</q>
(Tisch.) these words. The reference is to a MS. in the Imperial Library
at Vienna, (Nessel 302: Lambec. 34, which = our Paul 67), collated by Alter
(N.T. 1786, vol. ii. pp. 415-558), who says of it (p. 496),&mdash;<q><emph>cod.
ἐν Ἐφέσῳ punctis notat</emph>.</q> ... The MS. must have a curious history. H. Treschow
describes it in his <hi rend='italic'>Tentamen Descriptionis Codd. aliquot Graece</hi>,
&amp;c. Havn. 1773, pp. 62-73.&mdash;Also, A. C. Hwiid in his <hi rend='italic'>Libellus
Criticus de indole Cod. MS. Graeci N. T. Lambec. xxxiv.</hi> &amp;c. Havn.
1785.&mdash;It appears to have been corrected by some Critic,&mdash;perhaps from Cod.
B itself.</note>&mdash;and of <emph>all</emph> the Versions,&mdash;is
<emph>against</emph> the omission. In the face of this overwhelming mass
of unfaltering evidence to insist that Codd. B and א must
yet be accounted right, and all the rest of Antiquity wrong,
is simply irrational. To uphold the authority, in respect of
this nonsensical reading, of <emph>two</emph> MSS. confessedly untrustworthy
in countless other places,&mdash;against <emph>all</emph> the MSS.&mdash;<emph>all</emph>
the Versions,&mdash;is nothing else but an act of vulgar prejudice.
I venture to declare,&mdash;(and with this I shall close
the discussion and dismiss the subject,)&mdash;that <emph>there does not
exist one single instance in the whole of the New Testament</emph> of
a reading even probably correct in which the four following
notes of spurious origin concur,&mdash;which nevertheless are observed
to attach to the two readings which have been chiefly
discussed in the foregoing pages: viz.
</p>

<p>
1. The adverse testimony of <emph>all the uncial MSS. except
two</emph>.
</p>

<p>
2. The adverse testimony of all, or <emph>very nearly all</emph>, the
cursive MSS.
</p>

<pb n="100"/><anchor id="Pg100"/>

<p>
3. The adverse testimony of <emph>all the Versions</emph>, without exception.
</p>

<p>
4. The adverse testimony of <emph>the oldest Ecclesiastical Writers</emph>.
</p>

<p>
To which if I do not add, as I reasonably might,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
5. <emph>The highest inherent improbability</emph>,&mdash;it
is only because I desire to treat this question purely as
one of <emph>Evidence</emph>.
</p>

<p>
II. Learned men have tasked their ingenuity <emph>to account
for</emph> the phenomenon on which we have been bestowing so
many words. The endeavour is commendable; but I take
leave to remark in passing that if we are to set about discovering
reasons at the end of fifteen hundred years for
every corrupt reading which found its way into the sacred
text during the first three centuries subsequent to the death
of S. John, we shall have enough to do. Let any one take
up the Codex Bezae, (with which, by the way, Cod. B shews
marvellous sympathy<note place="foot">So indeed does Cod. א occasionally. See Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Collation</hi>, p. xlix.</note>,) and explain if he can why there
is a grave omission, or else a gross interpolation, in almost
every page; and how it comes to pass that Cod. D <q>reproduces
the <q>textus receptus</q> of the Acts much in the same
way that one of the best Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew
of the Old Testament; so wide are the variations in the
diction, so constant and inveterate the practice of expounding
the narrative by means of interpolations which seldom
recommend themselves as genuine by even a semblance of
internal probability.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction
to Codex Bezae</hi>, p. liv.</note> Our business as Critics is not <emph>to
invent theories</emph> to account for the errors of Copyists; but
rather to ascertain where they have erred, where not. What
with the inexcusable depravations of early Heretics,&mdash;the
preposterous emendations of ancient Critics,&mdash;the injudicious
assiduity of Harmonizers,&mdash;the licentious caprice of individuals;&mdash;what
with errors resulting from the inopportune
recollection of similar or parallel places,&mdash;or from the
familiar phraseology of the Ecclesiastical Lections,&mdash;or from
the inattention of Scribes,&mdash;or from marginal glosses;&mdash;however
arising, endless are the corrupt readings of the
oldest MSS. in existence; and it is by no means safe to
<pb n="101"/><anchor id="Pg101"/>
follow up the detection of a depravation of the text with
a theory to account for its existence. Let me be allowed to
say that such theories are seldom satisfactory. <emph>Guesses</emph> only
they are at best.
</p>

<p>
Thus, I profess myself wholly unable to accept the suggestion
of Ussher,&mdash;(which, however, found favour with Garnier
(Basil's editor), Bengel, Benson, and Michaelis; and
has since been not only eagerly advocated by Conybeare and
Howson following a host of German Critics, but has even
enjoyed Mr. Scrivener's distinct approval;)&mdash;that the Epistle
to the Ephesians <q>was <emph>a Circular</emph> addressed to other Asiatic
Cities besides the capital Ephesus,&mdash;to Laodicea perhaps
among the rest (Col. iv. 16); and that while some Codices
may have contained the name of Ephesus in the first verse,
<emph>others may have had another city substituted, or the space after</emph>
τοῖς οὔσιν <emph>left utterly void</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener,
<hi rend='italic'>Coll. of Cod. Sin.</hi> p. xlv.</note> At first sight, this conjecture
has a kind of interesting plausibility which recommends it
to our favour. On closer inspection,&mdash;(i) It is found to be
not only gratuitous; but (ii) altogether unsupported and unsanctioned
by the known facts of the case; and (what is
most to the purpose) (iii) it is, as I humbly think, demonstrably
erroneous. I demur to it,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1) Because of its exceeding Improbability: for (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) when
S. Paul sent his Epistle to the Ephesians we know that
Tychicus, the bearer of it,<note place="foot">Eph. vi. 21, 22.</note>
was charged with <emph>a distinct Epistle</emph> to the
Colossians:<note place="foot">Coloss. iv. 7, 16.</note> an
Epistle nevertheless so singularly like the Epistle to the Ephesians that it is scarcely
credible S. Paul would have written those two several Epistles
to two of the Churches of Asia, and yet have sent only
a duplicate of one of them, (<emph>that</emph> to the Ephesians,) furnished
with a different address, to so large and important a place
as Laodicea, for example, (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Then further, the provision
which S. Paul made at this very time for communicating with
the Churches of Asia which he did not separately address is
found to have been different. The Laodiceans were to read
in their public assembly S. Paul's <q><hi rend='italic'>Epistle to the
Colossians</hi>,</q> which the Colossians were ordered to send them. The Colossians
<pb n="102"/><anchor id="Pg102"/>
in like manner were to read the Epistle,&mdash;(to whom
addressed, we know not),&mdash;which S. Paul describes as τὴν ἐκ
Λαοδικείας.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ubi suprà</hi>.</note>
If then it had been S. Paul's desire that the
Laodiceans (suppose) should read publicly in their Churches
his Epistle to the Ephesians, surely, he would have charged
the Ephesians to procure that <emph>his Epistle to them should be
read in the Church of the Laodiceans</emph>. Why should the
Apostle be gratuitously assumed to have simultaneously
adopted one method with the Churches of <emph>Colosse</emph> and Laodicea,&mdash;another
with the Churches of <emph>Ephesus</emph> and Laodicea,&mdash;in
respect of his epistolary communications?
</p>

<p>
(2) (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) But even supposing, for argument's sake, that
S. Paul <emph>did</emph> send duplicate copies of his Epistle to the Ephesians
to certain of the principal Churches of Asia Minor,&mdash;why
should he have left the salutation <emph>blank</emph>, (<q>carta bianca,</q>
as Bengel phrases it,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Gnomon</hi>, in Ephes. i.
1, <hi rend='italic'>ad init.</hi></note>) for Tychicus to fill up when he got
into Asia Minor? And yet, by the hypothesis, nothing short
of <emph>this</emph> would account for the reading of Codd. B and א.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Let the full extent of the demand which is made on
our good nature be clearly appreciated. We are required to
believe that there was (1) A copy of what we call S. Paul's
<q>Epistle to the Ephesians</q> sent into Asia Minor by S. Paul
with a blank address; i.e. <q>with the space after τοῖς οὔσιν
left utterly void:</q> (2) That Tychicus neglected to fill up
that blank: and, (what is remarkable) (3) That no one was
found to fill it up for him. Next, (4) That the same copy
became the fontal source of the copy seen by Origen, and
(5) Of the <q>old copies</q> seen by Basil; as well as (6) Of
Codd. B and א. And even this is not all. The same hypothesis
constrains us to suppose that, on the contrary, (7) <emph>One
other</emph> copy of this same <q>Encyclical Epistle,</q> filled up with
the Ephesian address, became the archetype of <emph>every other
copy of this Epistle in the world</emph>.... But of what nature,
(I would ask,) is the supposed necessity for building up such
a marvellous structure of hypothesis,&mdash;of which the top story
overhangs and overbalances all the rest of the edifice? The
thing which puzzles us in Codd. B and א is not that we find
the name of <emph>another City</emph> in the salutation of S. Paul's <q>Epistle
<pb n="103"/><anchor id="Pg103"/>
to the Ephesians,</q> but that we find the name of <emph>no</emph> city
at all; nor meet with any vacant space there.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) On the other hand, supposing that S. Paul actually did
address to different Churches copies of the present Epistle,
and was scrupulous (as of course he was) to fill in the addresses
himself before the precious documents left his hands,&mdash;then,
doubtless, each several Church would have received,
cherished, and jealously guarded its own copy. But if <emph>this</emph> had
been the case, (or indeed if Tychicus had filled up the blanks
for the Apostle,) is it not simply incredible that we should
never have heard a word about the matter until now? unaccountable,
above all, that there should nowhere exist traces
of <emph>conflicting testimony</emph> as to the Church to which S. Paul's
Epistle to the Ephesians was addressed? whereas <emph>all</emph> the
most ancient writers, without exception,&mdash;(Marcion himself
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 140<note place="foot">See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg093">93-6</ref>. As for the supposed testimony of Ignatius
(<hi rend='italic'>ad Ephes.</hi> c. xii.), see the notes, ed. Jacobson. See also
Lardner, vol. ii.</note>], the <q>Muratorian</q> fragment
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 170 or earlier],
Irenæus [<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 175], Clemens Alexandrinus, Tertullian, Origen,
Dionysius Alexandrinus, Cyprian, Eusebius,)&mdash;and all copies
wheresoever found, give one unvarying, unfaltering witness.
Even in Cod. B. and Cod. א, (and this is much to be noted,)
the <emph>superscription</emph> of the Epistle attests that it was addressed
<q>to the Ephesians.</q> Can we be warranted (I would respectfully
inquire) in inventing facts in the history of an Apostle's
practice, in order to account for what seems to be after all
only an ordinary depravation of his text?<note place="foot"><p>Let it be clearly
understood by the advocates of this expedient for accounting
for the state of the text of Codd. B. and א, that nothing whatever is gained
for the credit of those two MSS. by their ingenuity. Even if we grant them
all they ask, the Codices in question remain, by their own admission,
<emph>defective</emph>.
</p>
<p>
Quite plain is it, by the very hypothesis, that one of two courses alone remains
open to them in editing the text: either (1) <emph>To leave a blank space</emph> after
τοῖς οὔσιν: or else, (2) <emph>To let the words</emph> ἐν Ἐφέσῳ
<emph>stand</emph>,&mdash;which I respectfully suggest is the wisest thing they can do.
[For with Conybeare and Howson (<hi rend='italic'>Life and Letters of S. Paul</hi>, ii.
491), to eject the words <q>at Ephesus</q> from the text of Ephes. i. 1, and actually
to substitute in their room the words <q>in Laodicea,</q>&mdash;is plainly abhorrent
to every principle of rational criticism. The remarks of C. and H. on this subject
(pp. 486 ff) have been faithfully met and sufficiently disposed of by Dean Alford
(vol. iii. <hi rend='italic'>Prolegg.</hi> pp. 13-8); who infers, <q>in accordance
with the prevalent belief of the Church in all ages, that this Epistle was
<emph>veritably addressed to the Saints in Ephesus</emph>, and <emph>to no other
Church</emph>.</q>] In the former case, they will be exhibiting a curiosity; viz. they
will be shewing us how (they think) a duplicate (<q>carta bianca</q>) copy of the
Epistle looked with <q>the space after τοῖς οὔσι left utterly void:</q> in the latter,
they will be representing the archetypal copy which was sent to the Metropolitan
see of Ephesus. But by printing the text thus,&mdash;τοῖς ἁγίοις τοῖς οὔσιν
[ἐν Ἐφέσω] καὶ πιστοῖς κ.τ.λ., they are acting on an entirely different theory.
They are merely testifying their mistrust of the text of every MS. in the world
except Codd. B and א. This is clearly to forsake the <q>Encyclical</q> hypothesis
altogether, and to put Ephes. i. 1 on the same footing as any other disputed
text of Scripture which can be named.

(3) But, in fact, it is high time to point out that such
<q><emph>a Circular</emph></q> as was described above, (each copy furnished
with a blank, to be filled up with the name of a different
City,) would be a document without parallel in the annals of
the primitive Church. It is, as far as I am aware, essentially
a modern notion. I suspect, in short, that the suggestion
before us is only another instance of the fatal misapprehension
which results from the incautious transfer of the
notions suggested by some familiar word in a living language
to its supposed equivalent in an ancient tongue. Thus, because
κύκλιος or ἐγκύκλιος confessedly signifies <q>circularis,</q>
it seems to be imagined that ἐγκύκλιος ἐπιστολή may mean
<q>a Circular Letter.</q> Whereas it really means nothing of
the sort; but&mdash;<q><emph>a Catholic Epistle</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Ἐγκύκλιον

As for <q><emph>a blank circular</emph></q> to be filled up with
<pb n="105"/><anchor id="Pg105"/>
the words <q>in Ephesus,</q> <q>in Laodicea,</q> &amp;c.,&mdash;its like (I repeat)
is wholly unknown in the annals of Ecclesiastical
Antiquity. The two notions are at all events inconsistent
and incompatible. If S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians
was <q>a Circular,</q> then it was not <q>Encyclical:</q> if it was
<q>Encyclical</q> then it was not <q>a Circular.</q>
</p>

<p>
Are we then deliberately to believe, (for to this necessity
we are logically reduced,) that the Epistle which occupies
the fifth place among S. Paul's writings, and which from
the beginning of the second century,&mdash;that is, from the
very dawn of Historical evidence,&mdash;has been known as
<q>the Epistle to the Ephesians,</q> was an <q>Encyclical,</q> <q>Catholic</q>
or <q>General Epistle,</q>&mdash;addressed τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς
οὔσι, καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χριστῷ Ἰησοῦ? There does not live
the man who will accept so irrational a supposition. The
suggestion therefore by which it has been proposed to account
for the absence of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in Ephes. i. 1
is not only in itself in the highest degree improbable, and
contradicted by all the evidence to which we have access;
but it is even inadmissible on critical grounds, and must
be unconditionally surrendered.<note place="foot"><p><q>On the whole,</q> says
Bishop Middleton, (<hi rend='italic'>Doctrine of the Greek Art.</hi>
p. 355) <q>I see nothing so probable as the opinion of Macknight (on Col. iv.
16,)&mdash;<q>that the Apostle sent the Ephesians word by Tychicus, who carried their
letter, to send a copy of it to the Laodiceans; with an order to them to communicate
it to the Colossians.</q></q>&mdash;This suggestion is intended to meet
<emph>another</emph> difficulty, and leaves the question of the reading of Ephes. i. 1
untouched. It proposes only to explain what S. Paul means by the enigmatical expression
which is found in Col. iv. 16.
</p>
<p>
Macknight's suggestion, though it has found favour with many subsequent
Divines, appears to me improbable in a high degree. S. Paul is found not to
have sent <emph>the Colossians</emph> <q>word by Tychicus, who carried their letter, to
send a copy of it to the Laodiceans.</q> He charged them, himself, to do so. Why,
at the same instant, is the Apostle to be thought to have adopted two such
different methods of achieving one and the same important end? And why,
instead of this roundabout method of communication, were not <emph>the Ephesians</emph>
ordered,&mdash;if not by S. Paul himself, at least by Tychicus,&mdash;to send a copy of
their Epistle to Colosse direct? And why do we find the Colossians charged
to read publicly τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικείας, which (by the hypothesis) would have been
only a copy,&mdash;instead of τὴν ἐξ Ἐφέσου, which, (by the same hypothesis,) would
have been the original? Nay, why is it not designated by S. Paul, τὴν πρὸς
Ἐφεσίους,&mdash;(if indeed it was his Epistle to the Ephesians which is alluded to,)
instead of τὴν ἐκ Λαοδικείας; which would hardly be an intelligible way of
indicating the document? Lastly, why are not the Colossians ordered to communicate
a copy of their Epistle to the illustrious Church of the <emph>Ephesians</emph>
also, which had been originally addressed by S. Paul? If the Colossians must
needs read the Epistle (so like their own) which the Apostle had just written
to the Ephesians, surely the Ephesians must also be supposed to have required
a sight of the Epistle which S. Paul had at the same time written to the
Colossians!</p></note> It is observed to collapse
before every test which can be applied to it.

<p>
III. Altogether marvellous in the meantime it is to me,&mdash;if
men must needs account for the omission of the words
ἐν Ἐφέσῳ from this place,&mdash;that they should have recourse
to wild, improbable, and wholly unsupported theories, like
those which go before; while an easy,&mdash;I was going to say
the obvious,&mdash;solution of the problem is close at hand, and
even solicits acceptance.
</p>

<p>
Marcion the heretic, (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 140) is distinctly charged by
Tertullian (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 200), and by Jerome a century and a half
later, with having abundantly mutilated the text of Scripture,
and of S. Paul's Epistles in particular. Epiphanius
compares the writing which Marcion tampered with to a moth-eaten
coat.<note place="foot">Epiphan. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. 311 D.</note>
<q>Instead of a stylus,</q> (says Tertullian,)
<q>Marcion employed a knife.</q> <q>What wonder if he
omits syllables, since often he omits whole pages?</q><note place="foot"><q>Marcion
exerte et palam machæra non stilo usus est, quoniam ad materiam
suam cædem Scripturarum confecit.</q> (Tertullian <hi rend='italic'>Præscript.
Hær.</hi> c. 38, p. 50.) <q>Non miror si syllabas subtrahit, cum paginas totas plerumque
subducat.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Adv. Marcion.</hi> lib. v, c. xvii, p. 455.)</note> S.
Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, Tertullian even singles out by
name; accusing Marcion of having furnished it with a new
title. All this has been fully explained above, from page <ref target="Pg093">93</ref>
to page 96.
</p>

<p>
Now, that Marcion recognised as S. Paul's Epistle <q><emph>to
the Ephesians</emph></q> that Apostolical writing which stands fifth
in our Canon, (but which stood seventh in his,) is just as
certain as that he recognised as such S. Paul's Epistles to
the Galatians, Corinthians, Romans, Thessalonians, Colossians,
<pb n="107"/><anchor id="Pg107"/>
Philippians. All this has been fully explained in
a preceding page.<note place="foot">See above p. <ref target="Pg095">95</ref>,
and see note (f) p. <ref target="Pg094">94</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
But it is also evident that Marcion put forth as S. Paul's
<emph>another</emph> Epistle,&mdash;of which all we know for certain is, that it
contained portions of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and purported
to be addressed by S. Paul <q>to the Laodiceans.</q> To
ascertain with greater precision the truth of this matter at the
end of upwards of seventeen centuries is perhaps impossible.
Nor is it necessary. Obvious is it to suspect that not only
did this heretical teacher at some period of his career prefix
a new heading to certain copies of the Epistle to the Ephesians,
but also that some of his followers industriously erased
from certain other copies the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ in ver. 1,&mdash;as
being <emph>the only two words in the entire Epistle</emph> which effectually
refuted their Master. It was not needful, (be it observed,)
to multiply copies of the Epistle for the propagation of
Marcion's deceit. Only two words had to be erased,&mdash;<emph>the
very two words whose omission we are trying to account for</emph>,&mdash;in
order to give some colour to his proposed attribution of
the Epistle, (<q>quasi in isto diligentissimus explorator,</q>)&mdash;to
the Laodiceans. One of these mutilated copies will have
fallen into the hands of Origen,&mdash;who often complains of the
corrupt state of his text: while the critical personages for
whom Cod. B and Cod. א were transcribed will probably
have been acquainted with other such mutilated copies. Are
we not led, as it were by the hand, to take some such view
of the case? In this way we account satisfactorily, and on
grounds of historic evidence, for the omission which has
exercised the Critics so severely.
</p>

<p>
I do not lose sight of the fact that the Epistle to the
Ephesians ends without salutations, without personal notices
of any kind. But in this respect it is not peculiar.<note place="foot">See, by all
means, Alford on this subject, vol. iii. <hi rend='italic'>Prolegg.</hi> pp.
13-15.</note> <emph>That</emph>,&mdash;joined
to a singular absence of identifying allusion,&mdash;sufficiently
explains why Marcion selected this particular Epistle
for the subject of his fraud. But, to infer from this circumstance,
in defiance of the Tradition of the Church Universal,
and in defiance of its very Title, that the Epistle is
<pb n="108"/><anchor id="Pg108"/>
<q>Encyclical,</q> in the technical sense of that word; and to go
on to urge this characteristic as an argument in support of
the omission of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ,&mdash;is clearly the device of
an eager Advocate; not the method of a calm and unprejudiced
Judge. True it is that S. Paul,&mdash;who, writing to
the Corinthians from Ephesus, says <q><emph>the Churches of Asia</emph>
salute you,</q> (1 Cor. xvi. 19,)&mdash;may have known very well
that an Epistle of his <q>to the Ephesians,</q> would, as a matter
of course, be instantly communicated to others besides
the members of that particular Church: and in fact this
may explain why there is nothing specially <q>Ephesian</q> in
the contents of the Epistle. The Apostle,&mdash;(as when he
addressed <q>the Churches of Galatia,</q>)&mdash;may have had certain
of the other neighbouring Churches in his mind while
he wrote. But all this is wholly foreign to the question
before us: the one <emph>only</emph> question being <emph>this</emph>,&mdash;Which of the
three following addresses represents what S. Paul must be
considered to have actually written in the first verse of his
<q>Epistle to the Ephesians</q>?&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1) τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς οὔσιν ἐν Ἐφέσῳ καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χ. Ἰ.
</p>

<p>
(2) τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς οὔσιν ἐν ... καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χ. Ἰ.
</p>

<p>
(3) τοῖς ἀγίοις τοῖς οὔσι, καὶ πιστοῖς ἐν Χ. Ἰ.
</p>

<p>
What I have been saying amounts to this: that it is absolutely
unreasonable for men to go out of their way to invent
a theory wanting every element of probability in order to
account for the omission of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ from
S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians; while they have under
their eyes the express testimony of a competent witness of
the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> century that a certain heretic,
named Marcion, <q>presumed to prefix an unauthorized title to that very Epistle,</q>
(<q>Marcion ei titulum aliquando interpolare gestiit,</q>)&mdash;which
title obviously <emph>could not stand unless those two words were first
erased from the text</emph>. To interpolate that new title, and to
erase the two words which were plainly inconsistent with it,
were obviously correlative acts which must always have been
performed together.
</p>

<p>
But however all this may be, (as already pointed out,)
the only question to be determined by us is,&mdash;whether it
be credible that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ are an unauthorized
<pb n="109"/><anchor id="Pg109"/>
addition; foisted into the text of Ephes. i. 1 as far back as
the Apostolic age: an interpolation which, instead of dying
out, and at last all but disappearing, has spread and established
itself, until the words are found in every copy,&mdash;are
represented in every translation,&mdash;have been recognised in
every country,&mdash;witnessed to by every Father,&mdash;received in
every age of the Church? I repeat that the one question
which has to be decided is, not <emph>how</emph> the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ came
to be put in, or came to be left out; but simply whether, on
an impartial review of the evidence, it be reasonable (with
Tischendorf, Tregelles, Conybeare and Howson, and so many
more,) to suspect their genuineness and enclose them in
brackets? Is it <emph>credible</emph> that the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ are a spurious
and unauthorized addition to the inspired autograph
of the Apostle?... We have already, as I think, obtained
a satisfactory answer to this question. It has been shewn,
as conclusively as in inquiries of this nature is possible, that
in respect of the reading of Ephesians i. 1, Codd. B and א
are even <emph>most</emph> conspicuously at fault.
</p>

<p>
IV. But if these two Codices are thus convicted of error
in respect of the one remaining text which their chief upholders
have selected, and to which they still make their
most confident appeal,&mdash;what remains, but to point out that
it is high time that men should be invited to disabuse their
minds of the extravagant opinion which they have been so
industriously taught to entertain of the value of the two
Codices in question? It has already degenerated into an
unreasoning prejudice, and threatens at last to add one more
to the already overgrown catalogue of <q>vulgar errors.</q>
</p>

<p>
V. I cannot, I suppose, act more fairly by Tischendorf
than by transcribing in conclusion his remarks on the four
remaining readings of Codex א to which he triumphantly
appeals: promising to dismiss them all with a single remark.
He says, (addressing unlearned readers,) in his <q>Introduction</q>
to the Tauchnitz (English) New Testament<note place="foot">p. xiv.&mdash;See above,
pp. <ref target="Pg008">8</ref>, <ref target="Pg009">9</ref>, note (f).</note>:&mdash;
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>To these examples, others might be added. Thus, Origen
says on John i. 4, that in some copies it was written, <q>in
Him <emph>is</emph> life</q> for <q>in Him <emph>was</emph> life.</q> This is a reading
which
<pb n="110"/><anchor id="Pg110"/>
we find in sundry quotations before the time of Origen;<note place="foot"><p>One is
rather surprised to find the facts of the case so unfairly represented
in addressing unlearned readers; who are entitled to the largest amount of
ingenuousness, and to entire sincerity of statement. The facts are these:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1) Valentt. (<hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Irenæum), (2) Clemens Alex., and (3) Theodotus
(<hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Clem.) read ἔστι: but then (1) Irenæus himself, (2) Clemens
Alex., and (3) Theodotus (<hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Clem.) <hi rend='italic'>also</hi>
read ἦν. These testimonies, therefore, clearly neutralize each other. Cyprian also has
<emph>both</emph> readings.&mdash;Hippolytus, on the other hand, reads ἔστι; but Origen,
(though he remarks that ἔστι is <q>perhaps not an improbable reading,</q>) reads ἦν
<emph>ten or eleven times</emph>. Ἦν is also the reading of Eusebius, of Chrysostom, of
Cyril, of Nonnus, of Theodoret,&mdash;of the Vulgate, of the Memphitic, of the Peshito,
and of the Philoxenian Versions; as well as of B, A, C,&mdash;in fact of <emph>all the
MSS. in the world</emph>, except of א and D.
</p>
<p>
All that remains to be set on the other side are the Thebaic and Cureton's
Syriac, together with most copies of the early Latin.
</p>
<p>
And now, with the evidence thus all before us, will any one say that it is
lawfully a question for discussion which of these two readings must exhibit the
genuine text of S. John i. 4? (For I treat it as a question of authority, and
reason from <emph>the evidence</emph>,&mdash;declining to import into the argument what
may be called <emph>logical</emph> considerations; though I conceive them to be all on
my side.) I suspect, in fact, that the inveterate practice of the primitive age of
reading the place after the following strange fashion,&mdash;ὁ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν,
was what led to this depravation of the text. Cyril in his Commentary [heading of
lib. i, c. vi.] so reads S. John i. 3, 4. And to substitute ἐστί (for ἦν) in such
a sentence as <emph>that</emph>, was obvious.... Chrysostom's opinion is well known,
<q>Let us beware of putting the full stop</q> (he says) <q>at the words οὐδὲ ἐν,&mdash;as
do the heretics.</q> [He alludes to Valentinus, Heracleon (Orig.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. 130), and to Theodotus (<hi rend='italic'>apud</hi> Clem.
Alex.). But it must be confessed that Irenæus, Hippolytus (<hi rend='italic'>Routh,
Opusc.</hi> i. 68), Clemens Alex., Origen, Concil. Antioch.
(<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 269, <hi rend='italic'>Routh</hi>
iii. 293), Theophilus Antioch., Athanasius, Cyril of Jer.,&mdash;besides of the
Latins, Tertullian, Lactantius, Victorinus (<hi rend='italic'>Routh</hi> iii. 459), and
Augustine,&mdash;point the place in the same way. <q>It is worth our observation,</q>
(says Pearson,) <q>that Eusebius citing the place of S. John to prove that the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Holy Ghost</hi> was made by the <hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi>,
leaves out those words twice together by which the Catholics used to refute that heresy
of the Arians, viz. ὁ γέγονεν.</q>]
</p>
<p>
Chrysostom proceeds,&mdash;<q>In order to make out that <hi rend="smallcaps">the
Spirit</hi> is a creature, they read Ὁ γέγονε, ἐν αὐτῳ ζωὴ ἦν; by which means, the
Evangelist's language is made unintelligible.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> viii.
40.)&mdash;This punctuation is nevertheless adopted by Tregelles,&mdash;but not by
Tischendorf. The Peshito, Epiphanius (quoted in Pearson's note, referred to
<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>), Cyprian, Jerome and the Vulgate divide the sentence
as we do.&mdash;See by all means
on this subject Pearson's <hi rend='italic'>note</hi> (<hi rend='italic'>z</hi>),
<hi rend="smallcaps">Art.</hi> viii, (ii. p. 262 ed. Burton). Also Routh's
<hi rend='italic'>Opusc.</hi> i. 88-9.</p></note>
but now, among all known Greek MSS. it is <emph>only in the
Sinaitic, and the famous old Codex Bezae</emph>, a copy of the
Gospels at Cambridge; yet it is also found in most of the
early Latin versions, in the most ancient Syriac, and in
the oldest Coptic.&mdash;Again, in Matth. xiii. 35, Jerome observes
<pb n="111"/><anchor id="Pg111"/>
that in the third century Porphyry, the antagonist
of Christianity, had found fault with the Evangelist Matthew
for having said, <q>which was spoken by the prophet Esaias.</q>
A writing of the second century had already witnessed to
the same reading; but Jerome adds further that well-informed
men had long ago removed the name of Esaias.
Among all our MSS. of a thousand years old and upwards,
<emph>there is not a solitary example containing the name of Esaias in
the text referred to,&mdash;except the Sinaitic</emph>, to which a few of
less than a thousand years old may be added.&mdash;Once more,
Origen quotes John xiii. 10 six times; but <emph>only the Sinaitic
and several ancient Latin MSS.</emph> read it the same as Origen:
<q>He that is washed needeth not to wash, but is clean every
whit.</q>&mdash;In John vi. 51, also, where the reading is very difficult
to settle, the <emph>Sinaitic is alone among all Greek copies</emph> indubitably
correct; and Tertullian, at the end of the second
century, confirms the Sinaitic reading: <q>If any man eat of
my bread, he shall live for ever. The bread that I will give
for the life of the world is my flesh.</q> We omit to indicate
further illustrations of this kind, although there are many
others like them.</q><note place="foot"><p>It may not be altogether useless that I
should follow this famous Critic of the text of the N. T. over the ground which he
has himself chosen. He challenges attention for the four following readings of the
Codex Sinaiticus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
(1.) <hi rend="smallcaps">S. John</hi> i. 4: εν αυτω ζωη εστιν.&mdash;(2.)
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Matth.</hi> xiii. 35: το ρηθεν δια ησαιου του
προφετου.&mdash;(3.) <hi rend="smallcaps">S. John</hi> xiii. 10: ο λελουμενος ουχ εχι
χρειαν νιψασθαι.&mdash;(4.) <hi rend="smallcaps">S. John</hi> vi. 51: αν τις φαγη εκ
του εμου αρυου, ζησει εις τον αιωνα;&mdash;ο αρτος ον εγω δωσω υπερ της του κοσμου
ζωης η σαρξ μου εστιν. (And this, Dr. Teschendorf asserts to be <q>indubitably
correct.</q>)
</p>
<p>
On inspection, these four readings prove to be exactly what might have been
anticipated from the announcement that they are almost the private property
of the single Codex א. The last three are absolutely worthless. They stand
self-condemned. To examine is to reject them: the second (of which Jerome
says something <emph>very</emph> different from what Tisch. pretends) and fourth being
only two more of those unskilful attempts at critical emendation of the inspired
Text, of which this Codex contains so many sorry specimens: the third being
clearly nothing else but the result of the carelessness of the transcriber.
Misled by the like ending (ὁμοιοτέλευτον) he has <emph>dropped a line</emph>:
thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ΟΥΧ ΕΧΙ ΧΡΕΙΑΝ [ΕΙ<lb/>
ΜΗ ΤΟΥΣ ΠΟΔΑΣ] ΝΙ<lb/>
ΨΑΣΘΑΙ ΑΛΛΑ ΕΣΤΙΝ
</p>
<p>
The first, I have discussed briefly in the foregoing footnote (p) p.
<ref target="Pg110">110</ref>.
</p></note>
</quote>

<p>
Let it be declared without offence, that there appears to
<pb n="112"/><anchor id="Pg112"/>
exist in the mind of this illustrious Critic a hopeless confusion
between the <emph>antiquity</emph> of a Codex and the <emph>value</emph> of its
readings. I venture to assert that a reading is valuable or
the contrary, exactly in proportion to the probability of its
being true or false. Interesting it is sure to be, be it what
it may, if it be found in a very ancient codex,&mdash;interesting
and often instructive: but the editor of Scripture must
needs bring every reading, wherever found, to this test at
last:&mdash;Is it to be thought that what I am here presented
with is what the Evangelist or the Apostle actually wrote?
If an answer in the negative be obtained to this question,
then, the fact that one, or two, or three of the early Fathers
appear to have so read the place, will not avail to impart to
the rejected reading one particle of <emph>value</emph>. And yet Tischendorf
thinks it enough in <emph>all</emph> the preceding passages to assure
his reader that a given reading in Cod. א was recognised by
Origen, by Tertullian, by Jerome. To have established this
one point he evidently thinks sufficient. There is implied in
all this an utterly false major premiss: viz. That Scriptural
quotations found in the writings of Origen, of Tertullian, of
Jerome, must needs be the <hi rend='italic'>ipsissima verba</hi> of the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Spirit</hi>. Whereas it is notorious <q>that the worst corruptions
to which the New Testament has ever been subjected originated within
a hundred years after it was composed: that Irenæus and
the whole Western, with a portion of the Syrian Church,
used far inferior manuscripts to those employed by Stunica,
or Erasmus, or Stephens, thirteen centuries later, when
moulding the Textus Receptus.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, p. 386. The whole Chapter deserves careful
study.</note> And one is astonished that a Critic of so much sagacity, (who of course
knows better,) should deliberately put forth so gross a fallacy,&mdash;not
only without a word of explanation, a word of caution,
but in such a manner as inevitably to mislead an unsuspecting
reader. Without offence to Dr. Tischendorf, I must be
allowed to declare that, in the remarks we have been considering,
he shews himself far more bent on glorifying the
<q>Codex Sinaiticus</q> than in establishing the Truth of the
pure Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>. He convinces me that to have found
<pb n="113"/><anchor id="Pg113"/>
an early uncial Codex, is every bit as fatal as to have <q>taken
a gift.</q> Verily, <q><emph>it doth blind the eyes of the
wise</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Deut. xvi. 19.</note>
</p>

<p>
And with this, I shall conclude my remarks on these two
famous Codices. I humbly record my deliberate conviction
that when the Science of Textual Criticism, which is at present
only in its infancy, comes to be better understood; (and
a careful collation of every existing Codex of the New Testament
is one indispensable preliminary to its being ever
placed on a trustworthy basis;) a very different estimate
will be formed of the importance of not a few of those readings
which at present are received with unquestioning submission,
chiefly on the authority of Codex B and Codex א.
On the other hand, it is perfectly certain that no future collations,
no future discoveries, will ever make it credible that
the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel are a spurious
supplement to the Evangelical Narrative; or that the
words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ are an unauthorized interpolation of the
inspired Text.
</p>

<p>
And thus much concerning Codex B and Codex א.
</p>

<p>
I would gladly have proceeded at once to the discussion
of the <q>Internal Evidence,</q> but that the external testimony
commonly appealed to is not yet fully disposed of. There remain
to be considered certain ancient <q>Scholia</q> and <q>Notes,</q>
and indeed whatever else results from the critical inspection
of ancient MSS., whether uncial or cursive: and all this
may reasonably claim one entire Chapter to itself.

<p>
In the present Chapter, I propose to pass under review
whatever manuscript testimony still remains unconsidered;
our attention having been hitherto exclusively devoted to
Codices B and א. True, that the rest of the evidence may
be disposed of in a single short sentence:&mdash;<emph>The Twelve Verses
under discussion are found in every copy of the Gospels in existence
with the exception of Codices B and א</emph>. But then,
</p>

<p>
I. We are assured,&mdash;(by Dr. Tregelles for example,)&mdash;that
<q>a Note or a Scholion stating the absence of these verses
from <emph>many</emph>, from <emph>most</emph>, or from the <emph>most correct</emph>
copies (often from Victor or Severus) is found in twenty-five other cursive
Codices.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 254.</note>
Tischendorf has nearly the same words: <q>Scholia</q>
(he says) <q>in very many MSS. state that the Gospel of Mark
in the most ancient (and most accurate) copies ended at the
ninth verse.</q> That distinguished Critic supports his assertion
by appealing to seven MSS. in particular,&mdash;and referring
generally to <q>about twenty-five others.</q> Dr. Davidson
adopts every word of this blindfold.
</p>

<p>
1. Now of course if all that precedes were true, this department
of the Evidence would become deserving of serious
<pb n="115"/><anchor id="Pg115"/>
attention. But I simply <emph>deny the fact</emph>. I entirely deny that
the <q>Note or Scholion</q> which these learned persons affirm to
be of such frequent occurrence has any existence whatever,&mdash;except
in their own imaginations. On the other hand,
I assert that notes or scholia which state the exact reverse,
(viz. that <q>in the older</q> or <q>the more accurate copies</q> the
last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel <emph>are contained</emph>,) recur
even perpetually. The plain truth is this:&mdash;These eminent
persons have taken their information at second-hand,&mdash;partly
from Griesbach, partly from Scholz,&mdash;without suspicion
and without inquiry. But then they have slightly
misrepresented Scholz; and Scholz (1830) slightly misunderstood
Griesbach; and Griesbach (1796) took liberties with
Wetstein; and Wetstein (1751) made a few serious mistakes.
The consequence might have been anticipated. The
Truth, once thrust out of sight, certain erroneous statements
have usurped its place,&mdash;which every succeeding Critic now
reproduces, evidently to his own entire satisfaction; though
not, it must be declared, altogether to his own credit. Let
me be allowed to explain in detail what has occurred.
</p>

<p>
2. Griesbach is found to have pursued the truly German
plan of setting down <emph>all</emph> the twenty-five MSS.<note place="foot">Viz. Codd.
L, 1, 22, 24, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 108, 129, 137, 138,
143, 181, 186, 196, 199, 206, 209, 210, 221, 222.</note> and <emph>all</emph> the
five Patristic authorities which up to his time had been
cited as bearing on the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20:
giving the former <emph>in numerical order</emph>, and stating generally
concerning them that in one or other of those authorities
it would be found recorded <q>that the verses in question
were anciently <emph>wanting</emph> in some, or in most, or in almost
all the Greek copies, or in the most accurate ones:&mdash;or else
that they were <emph>found</emph> in a few, or in the more accurate
copies, or in many, or in most of them, specially in the
Palestinian Gospel.</q> The learned writer (who had made
up his mind long before that the verses in question are to
be rejected) no doubt perceived that this would be the most
convenient way of disposing of the evidence for and against:
but one is at a loss to understand how English scholars can
have acquiesced in such a slipshod statement for well nigh
<pb n="116"/><anchor id="Pg116"/>
a hundred years. A very little study of the subject would
have shewn them that Griesbach derived the first eleven of
his references from Wetstein,<note place="foot">Wetstein quoted 14 Codices in all:
but Griesbach makes no use of his reference to Reg. 2868, 1880, and 2282
(leg. 2242?) which = Evan. 15, 19, 299 (?) respectively.</note> the last fourteen
from Birch.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Variae Lectiones</hi>, &amp;c.
(1801, p. 225-6.)&mdash;He cites Codd. Vatt. 358, 756, 757, 1229 (= our 129, 137, 138,
143): Cod. Zelada (= 181): Laur. vi. 18, 34 (= 186, 195): Ven. 27 (= 210): Vind. Lamb.
38, 89, Kol. 4 (= 221, 222, 108): Cod. iv. (<hi rend='italic'>leg.</hi> 5 ?) S. Mariæ
Bened. Flor. (= 199): Codd. Ven. 6, 10 (= 206, 209.)</note>
As for Scholz, he unsuspiciously adopted Griesbach's fatal
enumeration of Codices; adding five to the number; and
only interrupting the series here and there, in order to
insert the quotations which Wetstein had already supplied
from certain of them. With Scholz, therefore, rests the
blame of everything which has been written since 1830
concerning the MS. evidence for this part of S. Mark's
Gospel; subsequent critics having been content to adopt his
statements without acknowledgment and without examination.
Unfortunately Scholz did his work (as usual) in such
a slovenly style, that besides perpetuating old mistakes he
invented new ones; which, of course, have been reproduced
by those who have simply translated or transcribed him.
And now I shall examine his note <q>(z)</q>,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Nov.
Test.</hi> vol. i. p. 199.</note> with which practically
all that has since been delivered on this subject
by Tischendorf, Tregelles, Davidson, and the rest, is identical.
</p>

<p>
(1.) Scholz (copying Griesbach) first states that in two
MSS. in the Vatican Library<note place="foot">Vat. 756, 757 = our Evan. 137, 138.</note>
the verses in question <q>are
marked with an asterisk.</q> The original author of this
statement was Birch, who followed it up by explaining the
fatal signification of this mark.<note place="foot">Quo signo tamquam censoria virgula
usi sunt librarii, qua Evangelistarum narrationes, in omnibus Codicibus non obvias,
tamquam dubias notarent.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Variae Lectiones</hi>, &amp;c. p.
225.</note> From that day to this,
the asterisks in Codd. Vatt. 756 and 757 have been religiously
reproduced by every Critic in turn; and it is universally
taken for granted that they represent two ancient
<pb n="117"/><anchor id="Pg117"/>
witnesses against the genuineness of the last twelve verses of
the Gospel according to S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
And yet, (let me say it without offence,) a very little
attention ought to be enough to convince any one familiar
with this subject that the proposed inference is absolutely
inadmissible. For, in the first place, a <emph>solitary</emph> asterisk (not
at all a rare phenomenon in ancient MSS.<note place="foot">In Cod. 264 (= Paris 65)
for instance, besides at S. Mk. xvi. 9, + occurs
at xi. 12, xii. 38, and xiv. 12. On the other hand, no such sign occurs at the
<hi rend='italic'>pericope de adulterá</hi>.</note>) has of necessity
no such signification. And even if it does sometimes indicate
that all the verses which follow are suspicious, (of
which, however, I have never seen an example,) it clearly
<emph>could</emph> not have that signification here,&mdash;for a reason which
I should have thought an intelligent boy might discover.
</p>

<p>
Well aware, however, that I should never be listened to,
with Birch and Griesbach, Scholz and Tischendorf, and indeed
every one else against me,&mdash;I got a learned friend at
Rome to visit the Vatican Library for me, and inspect the
two Codices in question.<note place="foot">Further obligations to the same
friend are acknowledged in the <ref target="Appendix_D">Appendix (D)</ref>.</note>
That he would find Birch right
<emph>in his facts</emph>, I had no reason to doubt; but I much more
than doubted the correctness of his proposed inference from
them. I even felt convinced that the meaning and purpose
of the asterisks in question would be demonstrably different
from what Birch had imagined.
</p>

<p>
Altogether unprepared was I for the result. It is found
that the learned Dane has here made one of those (venial,
but) unfortunate blunders to which every one is liable who
registers phenomena of this class in haste, and does not
methodize his memoranda until he gets home. To be brief,&mdash;<emph>there
proves to be no asterisk at all,&mdash;either in Cod. 756,
or in Cod. 757</emph>.
</p>

<p>
On the contrary. After ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ, the former Codex
has, in the text of S. Mark xvi. 9 (<hi rend='italic'>fol. 150 b</hi>), a plain
cross,&mdash;(<emph>not</emph> an asterisk, thus [symbol: x with dots in corners]
or [symbol: broken x with corner dots] or [symbol: inverse or open x], but a cross,
thus +),&mdash;the intention of which is to refer the reader to
an annotation on <hi rend='italic'>fol. 151 b</hi>, (marked, of course, with a cross
also,) <emph>to the effect that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is undoubtedly
<pb n="118"/><anchor id="Pg118"/>
genuine</emph>.<note place="foot">Similarly, in Cod. Coisl. 20, in the Paris Library,
(which = our 36,) against S. Mark xvi. 9, is this sign [symbol: inverse or open x].
It is intended (like an asterisk in a modern book) to refer the reader to the
self-same annotation which is spoken of in the text as occurring in Cod. Vat. 756,
and which is observed to occur in the margin of the Paris MS. also.</note>
The evidence, therefore, not only breaks hopelessly
down; but it is discovered that this witness has been
by accident put into the wrong box. This is, in fact, a witness
<emph>not</emph> for the plaintiff, but <emph>for the defendant!</emph>&mdash;As for
the other Codex, it exhibits neither asterisk nor cross; but contains
the same note or scholion attesting the genuineness of the
last twelve verses of S. Mark.
</p>

<p>
I suppose I may now pass on: but I venture to point
out that unless the Witnesses which remain to be examined
are able to produce very different testimony from that borne
by the last two, the present inquiry cannot be brought to
a close too soon. (<q>I took thee to curse mine enemies, and,
behold, thou hast blessed them altogether.</q>)
</p>

<p>
(2.) In Codd. 20 and 300 (Scholz proceeds) we read as
follows:&mdash;<q>From here to the end forms no part of the text
in some of the copies. <emph>In the ancient copies, however, it all
forms part of the text</emph>.</q><note place="foot">ἐντεῦθεν ἔως τοῦ τέλους ἔν
τισι τῶν ἀντιγράφων οὐ κεῖται: ἐν δε τοῖς ἀρχαίοις, πάντα ἀπαράλειπτα
κεῖται.&mdash;(Codd. 20 and 300 = Paris 188, 186.)</note> Scholz (who
was the first to adduce this important testimony to the genuineness of the verses
now under consideration) takes no notice of the singular circumstance
that the two MSS. he mentions have been <emph>exactly</emph>
assimilated in ancient times to a common model; and that
they correspond one with the other so entirely<note place="foot">See more concerning
this matter in the <ref target="Appendix_D">Appendix (D)</ref>, <hi rend='italic'>ad
fin.</hi></note> that the
foregoing rubrical annotation appears <emph>in the wrong place</emph> in
both of them, viz. <emph>at the close of ver.</emph> 15, where it interrupts
the text. This was, therefore, once a scholion written in
the margin of some very ancient Codex, which has lost its
way in the process of transcription; (for there can be no
doubt that it was originally written against ver. 8.) And
let it be noted that its testimony is express; and that it
avouches for the fact that <q><emph>in the ancient copies</emph>,</q> S. Mark
xvi. 9-20 <q><emph>formed part of the text</emph>.</q>
</p>

<pb n="119"/><anchor id="Pg119"/>

<p>
(3.) Yet more important is the record contained in the
same two MSS., (of which also Scholz says nothing,) viz.
that they exhibit a text which had been <q>collated with the
ancient and approved copies at Jerusalem.</q><note place="foot"><p>At the end of S.
Matthew's Gospel in Cod. 300 (at fol. 89) is found,&mdash;
</p>
<p>
εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ματθαῖον ἐγράφη καὶ ἀντεβλήθη ἐκ
τῶν Ἱεροσολύμοις παλαιὼν ἀντιγράφων, ἐν στίχοις βφιδ
</p>
<p>
and at the end of S. Mark's, (at fol. 147 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>)&mdash;
</p>
<p>
εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Ματθαῖον ἐγράφη καὶ ἀντεβλήθη ὁμοίως
ἐκ τῶν ἐσπουδασμένων στίχοις αφς κεφαλαίοις σλξ
</p>
<p>
This second colophon (though not the first) is found in Cod. 20. <emph>Both</emph>
reappear in Cod. 262 ( = Paris 53), and (with an interesting variety in the former
of the two) in [what I suppose is the first half of] the uncial Codex Λ. See
Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, p. 125.
</p></note> What need to
point out that so remarkable a statement, taken in conjunction
with the express voucher that <q>although some copies of
the Gospels are without the verses under discussion, yet that
<emph>in the ancient copies</emph> all the verses are found,</q> is a <emph>critical
attestation to the genuineness</emph> of S. Mark xvi. 9 to 20, far outweighing
the bare statement (next to be noticed) of the undeniable
historical fact that, <q><emph>in some copies</emph>,</q> S. Mark <emph>ends
at ver.</emph> 8,&mdash;but <q>in many <emph>does not</emph></q>?
</p>

<p>
(4.) Scholz proceeds:&mdash;<q>In Cod. 22, after ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ
+ τελος is read the following rubric:</q>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ἔν τισι τῶν ἀντιγράφων ἕως ὧδε πληροῦται ὁ εὐαγγελιστής:
ἐν πολλοῖς δὲ καὶ ταῦτα φέρεται.<note place="foot">= Paris 72,
<hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 107 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>. He might have added, (for
Wetstein had pointed it out 79 years before,) that <emph>the same note precisely</emph>
is found between verses 8 and 9 in Cod. 15 ( = Paris 64,) <hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi>
98 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
And the whole of this statement is complacently copied by
<emph>all</emph> subsequent Critics and Editors,&mdash;cross, and <q>τέλος,</q> and
all,&mdash;as an additional ancient attestation to the fact that
<q><emph>The End</emph></q> (τέλος) <emph>of S. Mark's Gospel</emph> is indeed at
ch. xvi. 8. Strange,&mdash;incredible rather,&mdash;that among so many learned
persons, not one should have perceived that <q>τέλος</q> in this
place merely denotes that here <emph>a well-known Ecclesiastical section
comes to an end</emph>!... As far, therefore, as the present discussion
is concerned, the circumstance is purely irrelevant;<note place="foot">See more at
the very end of <ref target="Chapter_XI">Chap. XI</ref>.</note>
<pb n="120"/><anchor id="Pg120"/>
and, (as I propose to shew in <ref target="Chapter_XI">Chapter XI</ref>,) the less said
about it by the opposite party, the better.
</p>

<p>
(5.) Scholz further states that in four, (he means three,)
other Codices very nearly the same colophon as the preceding
recurs, with an important additional clause. In Codd. 1,
199, 206, 209, (he says) is read,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>In certain of the copies, the Evangelist finishes here;
<emph>up to which place Eusebius the friend of Pamphilus canonized</emph>.
In other copies, however, is found as follows.</q><note place="foot"><p>Cod. 1.
(at Basle), and Codd. 206, 209 (which = Venet. 6 and 10) contain
as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ἔν τισι μὲν τῶν ἀντιγράφων ἕως ὧδε πληροῦται ὁ Εὐαγγελιστὴς,
ἕως οἱ καὶ Ἐυσέβιος ὁ Παμφίλου ἐκανόνισεν; ἐν
ἄλλοις δὲ ταῦτα φέρεται; ἀναστὰς, κ.τ.λ.
</p>
<p>
But Cod. 199 (which = S. Mariae Benedict. Flor. Cod. IV.
[<hi rend='italic'>lege</hi> 5],) according
to Birch (p. 226) who supplies the quotation, has only this:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
ἔν τισι τῶν ἀντιγράφων οὐ κεῖνται [?] ταῦτα.
</p></note> And then
comes the rest of S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
I shall have more to say about this reference to Eusebius,
and what he <q>canonized,</q> by-and-by. But what is there in
all this, (let me in the meantime ask), to recommend the
opinion that the Gospel of S. Mark was published by its
Author in an incomplete state; or that the last twelve
verses of it are of spurious origin?
</p>

<p>
(6.) The reader's attention is specially invited to the imposing
statement which follows. Codd. 23, 34, 39, 41, (says
Scholz,) <q rend="pre">contain these words of Severus of Antioch:&mdash;</q>
</p>

<quote rend="display">
<q>In the more accurate copies, the Gospel according to
Mark has its end at <q>for they were afraid.</q> In some copies,
however, this also is added,&mdash;<q>Now when He was risen,</q>
&amp;c. This, however, seems to contradict to some extent
what was before delivered,</q> &amp;c.
</quote>

<p>
It may sound fabulous, but it is strictly true, that every
word of this, (unsuspiciously adopted as it has been by <emph>every
Critic</emph> who has since gone over the same ground,) is a mere
tissue of mistakes. For first,&mdash;Cod. 23 contains <emph>nothing
whatever pertinent to the present inquiry</emph>. (Scholz, evidently
through haste and inadvertence, has confounded <emph>his own</emph>
<pb n="121"/><anchor id="Pg121"/>
<q>23</q> with <q><hi rend='italic'>Coisl.</hi> 23,</q> but <q>Coisl. 23</q> is his
<q>39,</q>&mdash;of which by-and-by. This reference therefore has to be
cancelled.)&mdash;Cod. 41 contains a scholion of <emph>precisely the opposite
tendency</emph>: I mean, a scholion which avers that <emph>the accurate
copies of S. Mark's Gospel contain these last twelve verses</emph>.
(Scholz borrowed this wrong reference from Wetstein,&mdash;who,
by an oversight, quotes Cod. 41 three times instead of twice.)&mdash;There
remain but Codd. 34 and 39; and in neither of
those two manuscripts, from the first page of S. Mark's Gospel
to the last, does there exist <emph>any <q>scholion of Severus
of Antioch</q> whatever</emph>. Scholz, in a word, has inadvertently
made a gross misstatement;<note place="foot">It originated in this way. At the end
of S. Matthew's Gospel, in both Codices, are found those large extracts from the
<q>2nd Hom. on the Resurrection</q> which Montfaucon published in the
<hi rend='italic'>Bibl. Coisl.</hi> (pp. 68-75), and which Cramer has since
reprinted at the end of his <hi rend='italic'>Catena in S. Matth.</hi> (i. 243-251.)
In Codd. 34 and 39 they are ascribed to <q>Severus of Antioch.</q> See
above (p. <ref target="Pg040">40</ref>.) See also pp. <ref target="Pg039">39</ref>
and <ref target="Pg057">57</ref>.</note> and every Critic who has since
written on this subject has adopted his words,&mdash;without
acknowledgment and without examination.... Such is the
evidence on which it is proposed to prove that S. Mark did
not write the last twelve verses of his Gospel!
</p>

<p>
(7.) Scholz proceeds to enumerate the following twenty-two
Codices:&mdash;24, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 108, 129, 137,
138, 143, 181, 186, 195, 199, 206, 209, 210, 221, 222. And
this imposing catalogue is what has misled Tischendorf,
Tregelles and the rest. They have not perceived that it is
<emph>a mere transcript of Griesbach's list</emph>; which Scholz interrupts
only to give from Cod. 24, (imperfectly and at second-hand,)
the weighty scholion, (Wetstein had given it from Cod. 41,)
which relates, on the authority of an eye-witness, that
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 existed in the ancient Palestinian Copy.
(About that Scholion enough has been offered already.<note place="foot">See above,
pp. <ref target="Pg064">64</ref>, <ref target="Pg065">65</ref>.</note>)
Scholz adds that very nearly the same words are found in
374.&mdash;What he says concerning 206 and 209 (and he might
have added 199,) has been explained above.
</p>

<p>
But when the twenty MSS. which remain<note place="foot">22-3 (199, 206, 209) = 19
+ 1 (374) = 20.</note> undisposed of
have been scrutinized, their testimony is found to be quite
<pb n="122"/><anchor id="Pg122"/>
different from what is commonly supposed. One of them
(No. 38) has been cited in error: while the remaining nineteen
are nothing else but copies of <emph>Victor of Antioch's commentary
on S. Mark</emph>,&mdash;no less than <emph>sixteen</emph> of which contain
the famous attestation that in <emph>most of the accurate copies, and
in particular the authentic Palestinian Codex, the last twelve
verses of S. Mark's Gospel</emph> <hi rend="smallcaps">were found</hi>. (See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg064">64</ref> and <ref target="Pg065">65</ref>.).... And this exhausts
the evidence.
</p>

<p>
(8.) So far, therefore, as <q>Notes</q> and <q>Scholia</q> in MSS.
are concerned, the sum of the matter proves to be simply
this:&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Nine Codices<note place="foot">viz. Codd.
L, 1, 199, 208, 209:&mdash;20, 300:&mdash;15, 22.</note> are
observed to contain a note to the effect that the end of S. Mark's
Gospel, though wanting <q>in some,</q> was yet found <q>in others,</q>&mdash;<q>in
many,</q>&mdash;<q><emph>in the ancient copies</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Next, four Codices<note place="foot">Cod. Λ, 20, 262,
300.</note> contain subscriptions vouching
for the genuineness of this portion of the Gospel by declaring
that those four Codices had been <emph>collated with approved
copies preserved at Jerusalem</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Lastly, sixteen Codices,&mdash;(to which, besides that
already mentioned by Scholz,<note place="foot">Evan. 374.</note> I am able to add
at least five others, making twenty-two in all,<note place="foot">viz. Evan. 24, 36,
37, 40, 41 (Wetstein.) Add Evan. 108, 129, 137, 138, 143, 181, 186, 195, 210, 221,
222. (Birch <hi rend='italic'>Varr. Lectt</hi>. p. 225.) Add Evan. 374 (Scholz.) Add
Evan. 12, 129, 299, 329, and the Moscow Codex (qu. Evan. 253?) employed by
Matthaei.</note>)&mdash;contain a weighty
critical scholion asserting categorically that in <q>very many</q>
and <q>accurate copies,</q> specially in the <q>true Palestinian
exemplar,</q> <emph>these verses had been found by one who seems to
have verified the fact of their existence there for himself</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(9.) And now, shall I be thought unfair if, on a review
of the premisses, I assert that I do not see a shadow of
reason for the imposing statement which has been adopted
by Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest, that <q>there exist
about thirty Codices which state that from the more ancient
and more accurate copies of the Gospel, the last twelve
verses of S. Mark were absent?</q> I repeat, there is not so
much as <emph>one single Codex</emph> which contains such a scholion;
<pb n="123"/><anchor id="Pg123"/>
while twenty-four<note place="foot">2 (viz. Evan. 20, 200) + 16 + 1 + 5
(enumerated in the preceding note) = 24.</note> of those commonly enumerated state
<emph>the exact reverse</emph>.&mdash;We may now advance a step: but the
candid reader is invited to admit that hitherto the supposed
hostile evidence is on the contrary entirely <emph>in favour</emph>
of the verses under discussion. (<q>I called thee to curse
mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them
these three times.</q>)
</p>

<p>
II. Nothing has been hitherto said about Cod. L.<note place="foot">Paris 62,
<hi rend='italic'>olim,</hi> 2861 and 1558.</note> This
is the designation of an uncial MS. of the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
or ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, in the Library at Paris, chiefly remarkable for the
correspondence of its readings with those of Cod. B and
with certain of the citations in Origen; a peculiarity which
recommends Cod. L, (as it recommends three cursive Codices
of the Gospels, 1, 33, 69,) to the especial favour of a school
with which whatever is found in Cod. B is necessarily
right. It is described as the work of an ignorant foreign
copyist, who probably wrote with several MSS. before him;
but who is found to have been wholly incompetent to determine
which reading to adopt and which to reject. Certain
it is that he interrupts himself, at the end of ver. 8, to
write as follows:&mdash;

It cannot be needful that I should delay the reader with
any remarks on such a termination of the Gospel as the
foregoing. It was evidently the production of some one
who desired to remedy the conspicuous incompleteness of
his own copy of S. Mark's Gospel, but who had imbibed so
little of the spirit of the Evangelical narrative that he could
not in the least imitate the Evangelist's manner. As for the
scribe who executed Codex L, he was evidently incapable
of distinguishing the grossest fabrication from the genuine
text. The same worthless supplement is found in the margin
of the Hharklensian Syriac (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 616), and in a few other
quarters of less importance.<note place="foot">As, the Codex Bobbiensis (k) of the
old Latin, and the margin of two Æthiopic MSS.&mdash;I am unable to understand what
Scholz and his copyists have said concerning Cod. 274. I was assured again and again
at Paris that they knew of no such codex as <q>Reg, 79a,</q> which is Scholz'
designation (<hi rend='italic'>Prolegg.</hi> p. lxxx.) of the Cod. Evan. which,
after him, we number <q>274.</q></note>&mdash;I pass on, with the single
remark that I am utterly at a loss to understand on
what principle Cod. L,&mdash;a solitary MS. of the
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> or
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century which exhibits an exceedingly vicious text,&mdash;is to
<pb n="125"/><anchor id="Pg125"/>
be thought entitled to so much respectful attention on the
present occasion, rebuked as it is for the fallacious evidence
it bears concerning the last twelve verses of the second Gospel
by all the seventeen remaining Uncials, (three of which
are from 300 to 400 years more ancient than itself;) and by
<emph>every cursive copy of the Gospels in existence</emph>. Quite certain
at least is it that not the faintest additional probability is
established by Cod. L that S. Mark's Gospel when it left
the hands of its inspired Author was in a mutilated condition.
The copyist shews that he was as well acquainted
as his neighbours with our actual concluding Verses: while
he betrays his own incapacity, by seeming to view with
equal favour the worthless alternative which he deliberately
transcribes as well, and to which he gives the foremost
place. <emph>Not</emph> S. Mark's Gospel, <emph>but Codex L</emph> is the sufferer
by this appeal.
</p>

<p>
III. I go back now to the statements found in certain
Codices of the x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
(derived probably from one of
older date,) to the effect that <q>the marginal references
to the Eusebian Canons extend no further than ver. 8:</q>&mdash;for
so, I presume, may be paraphrased the words, (see p. <ref target="Pg120">120</ref>,)
ἕως οὖ Εὐσέβιους ὁ Παμφίλου ἐκανόνισεν, which are found
at the end of ver. 8 in Codd. 1, 206, 209.
</p>

<p>
(1.) Now this statement need not have delayed us for
many minutes. But then, therewith, recent Critics have
seen fit to connect another and an entirely distinct proposition:
viz. that
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>
</p>

<p>
also, a contemporary of Origen, conspires with Eusebius in
disallowing the genuineness of the conclusion of S. Mark's
Gospel. This is in fact a piece of evidence to which recently
special prominence has been given: every Editor of the
Gospels in turn, since Wetstein, having reproduced it; but
no one more emphatically than Tischendorf. <q>Neither by
<emph>the sections of Ammonius</emph> nor yet by the canons of Eusebius
are these last verses recognised</q><note place="foot">Nec
<hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonii</hi> Sectionibus, nec <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebii</hi>
Canonibus, agnoscuntur ultimi versus.&mdash;Tisch. <hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi>
(<hi rend='italic'>ed. 8va</hi>), p. 406.</note> <q>Thus it is seen,</q>
<pb n="126"/><anchor id="Pg126"/>
proceeds Dr. Tregelles, <q>that just as Eusebius found these
verses absent in his day from the best and most numerous
copies (<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>), <emph>so was also the case with Ammonius</emph> when
he formed his Harmony in the preceding
century.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 248.</note>
</p>

<p>
(The opposite page exhibits an <hi rend='italic'>exact Fac-simile</hi>, obtained by
Photography, of fol. 113 of <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan. Cod. L</hi>, (<q>Codex Regius,</q>

at pp. <ref target="Pg123">123-4</ref>. The Text of that MS. has been published
by Dr. Tischendorf in his <q>Monumenta Sacra Inedita,</q>
(1846, pp. 57-399.) See p. <ref target="Pg206">206</ref>.)

(The original Photograph was executed (Oct. 1869) by the
obliging permission of M. de Wailly, who presides over the

wishes and facilitated my researches.)
</p>

<p>
(It should perhaps be stated that <emph>the margin</emph> of <q>Codex L</q>
is somewhat ampler than can be represented in an octavo
volume; each folio measuring very nearly nine inches, by
very nearly six inches and a half.)
</p>

<p>
A new and independent authority therefore is appealed
to,&mdash;one of high antiquity and evidently very great importance,&mdash;Ammonius
of Alexandria, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 220. But Ammonius
has left behind him <emph>no known writings whatsoever</emph>. What
then do these men mean when they appeal in this confident
way to the testimony of <q>Ammonius?</q>
</p>

<p>
To make this matter intelligible to the ordinary English
reader, I must needs introduce in this place some account
of what are popularly called the <q>Ammonian Sections</q> and
the <q>Eusebian Canons:</q> concerning both of which, however,
it cannot be too plainly laid down that nothing whatever
is known beyond what is discoverable from a careful
study of the <q>Sections</q> and <q>Canons</q> themselves; added
to what Eusebius has told us in that short Epistle of his
<q>to Carpianus,</q>&mdash;which I suppose has been transcribed
and reprinted more often than any other uninspired Epistle
in the world.
</p>

<p>
Eusebius there explains that Ammonius of Alexandria
constructed with great industry and labour a kind of Evangelical
Harmony; the peculiarity of which was, that, retaining
S. Matthew's Gospel in its integrity, it exhibited
the corresponding sections of the other three Evangelists
by the side of S. Matthew's text. There resulted this inevitable
inconvenience; that the sequence of the narrative,
in the case of the three last Gospels, was interrupted
throughout; and their context hopelessly destroyed.<note place="foot">The reader
is invited to test the accuracy of what precedes for himself:&mdash;Ἀμμώνιος
μὲν ὁ Ἀλεξανδρεὺς, πολλὴν, ὡς εἰκὸς, φιλοπονίαν καὶ σπουδὴν εἰσαγηοχὼς,
τὸ διὰ τεσσάρων ἡμῖν καταλέλοιπεν εὐαγγέλιον, τῷ κατὰ Ματθαῖον τὰς
ὁμοφώνους τῶν λοιπῶν εὐαγγελιστῶν περικοπὰς παραθεὶς, ὥς ἐξ ἀνάγκης συμβῆναι
τὸν τῆς ἀκολουθίας εἱρμὸν τῶν τριῶν διαφθαρῆναι, ὅσον ἐπὶ τῷ ὅφει τῆς ἀναγνώσεως.</note>
</p>

<p>
The <q>Diatessaron</q> of Ammonius, (so Eusebius styles it),
has long since disappeared; but it is plain from the foregoing
account of it by a competent witness that it must
<pb n="127"/><anchor id="Pg127"/>
have been a most unsatisfactory performance. It is not
easy to see how room can have been found in such a scheme
for entire chapters of S. Luke's Gospel; as well as for the
larger part of the Gospel according to S. John: in short, for
anything which was not capable of being brought into some
kind of agreement, harmony, or correspondence with something
in S. Matthew's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
How it may have fared with the other Gospels in the
work of Ammonius is not in fact known, and it is profitless
to conjecture. What we know for certain is that Eusebius,
availing himself of the hint supplied by the very imperfect
labours of his predecessor, devised an entirely different expedient,
whereby he extended to the Gospels of S. Mark,
S. Luke and S. John all the advantages, (and more than all,)
which Ammonius had made the distinctive property of the
first Gospel.<note place="foot">Ἵνα δὲ σωζομένου καὶ τοῦ τῶν λοιπῶν δι᾽ ὅλου σώματός τε
καὶ εἱρμοῦ, εἰδέναι ἔχοις τοὺς οἰκείους ἑκάστου εὐαγγελιστοῦ τό πους, ἐν οἷς κατὰ τῶν
αὐτῶν ἠνέχθησαν φιλαληθῶς εἰπεῖν, ἐκ τοῦ πονήματος τοῦ προειρημένου ἀνδρὸς εἰληφὼς
ἀφορμὰς, καθ᾽ ἑτέραν μέθοδον κανόνας δέκα τὸν ἀριθμὸν διεχάραξά σοι τοὺς
ὑποτεταγμένους.</note> His plan was to retain the Four Gospels in
their integrity; and, besides enabling a reader to ascertain
at a glance the places which S. Matthew has in common
with the other three Evangelists, or with any two, or with
any one of them, (which, I suppose, was the sum of what
had been exhibited by the work of Ammonius,)&mdash;to shew
which places S. Luke has in common with S. Mark,&mdash;which
with S. John only; as well as which places are peculiar to
each of the four Evangelists in turn. It is abundantly clear
therefore what Eusebius means by saying that the labours
of Ammonius had <q><emph>suggested to him</emph></q> his own.<note place="foot">This
seems to represent <emph>exactly</emph> what Eusebius means in this place. The
nearest English equivalent to ἀφορμή is <q>a hint.</q> Consider Euseb.
<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Eccl.</hi> v. 27. Also the following:&mdash;πολλὰς λαβόντες
ἀφορμάς. (Andreas, <hi rend='italic'>Proleg. in Apocalyps.</hi>).&mdash;λαβόντες
τὰς ἀφρμάς. (Anastasius Sin., <hi rend='italic'>Routh's Rell.</hi> i. 15.)</note> The
sight of that Harmony of the other three Evangelists with
S. Matthew's Gospel had suggested to him the advantage
of establishing a series of parallels throughout <emph>all the Four
Gospels.</emph> But then, whereas Ammonius had placed alongside
of S. Matthew <emph>the dislocated sections themselves</emph> of the
<pb n="128"/><anchor id="Pg128"/>
other three Evangelists which are of corresponding purport,
Eusebius conceived the idea of accomplishing the same
object by means of a system of double numerical <emph>references</emph>.
He invented X Canons, or Tables: he subdivided each of the
Four Gospels into a multitude of short Sections. These he
numbered; (a fresh series of numbers appearing in each
Gospel, and extending from the beginning right on to the
end;) and immediately under every number, he inserted,
in vermillion, another numeral (I to X); whose office it was
to indicate in which of his X Canons, or Tables, the reader
would find the corresponding places in any of the other
Gospels.<note place="foot"><p>κανόνας ... διεχάραξά σοι τοὺς ὑποτεταγμένους. This
at least is decisive as to the authorship of the Canons. When therefore Jerome says
of Ammonius,&mdash;<q><emph>Evangelicos canones excogitavit</emph> quos postea
secutus est Eusebius Cæsariensis,</q> (<hi rend='italic'>De Viris Illust.</hi> c. lv.
vol. ii. p. 881,) we learn the amount of attention to which such off-hand gain
statements of this Father are entitled.
</p>
<p>
What else can be inferred from the account which Eusebius gives of the
present sectional division of the Gospels but that it was also his own?&mdash;Αὕτη
μὲν οὖν ἡ τὼν ὑποτεταγμένων κανόνων ὑπόθεσις: ἡ δὲ σαφὴς αὐτῶν διήγησις,
ἔστιν ἤδε. Ἐφ᾽ ἑκάστῳ τῶν τεσσάρων εὐαγγελίων ἀριθμός τις πρόκειται κατὰ
μέρος, ἀρχόμενος ἀπὸ τοῦ πρώτου, εἶτα δευτέρου, καὶ τρίτου, καὶ καθεξῆς προιὼν
δι᾽ ὅλου μέχρι τοῦ τέλους τοῦ βιβλίου. He proceeds to explain how the sections
thus numbered are to be referred to his X Canons:&mdash;καθ᾽ ἕκαστον δὲ ἀριθμὸν
ὑποσημείωσις διὰ κινναβάρεως πρόκειται, δηλοῦσα ἐν ποίῳ τῶν δέκα κανόνων κείμενος
ὁ ἀριθμὸς τυγχάνει.</p></note> (If the section was unique, it belonged to his last
or X<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Canon.) Thus, against S. Matthew's account
of the Title on the Cross, is written 335/I: but in the
I<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi> Canon
(which contains the places common to all four Evangelists)
parallel with 335, is found,&mdash;214, 324, 199: and the Sections
of S. Mark, S. Luke, and S. John thereby designated,
(which are discoverable by merely casting one's eye down
the margin of each of those several Gospels in turn, until
the required number has been reached,) will be found to
contain the parallel record in the other three Gospels.
</p>

<p>
All this is so purely elementary, that its very introduction
in this place calls for apology. The extraordinary
method of the opposite party constrains me however to
establish thus clearly the true relation in which the familiar
labours of Eusebius stand to the unknown work of
Ammonius.

<p>
For if that earlier production be lost indeed,<note place="foot"><p><q>Frustra ad
Ammonium aut Tatianum in Harmoniis provocant. Quæ
supersunt vix quicquam cum Ammonio aut Tatiano commune habent.</q> (Tischendorf
<hi rend='italic'>on S. Mark</hi> xvi. 8).&mdash;Dr. Mill (1707),&mdash;because he
assumed that the anonymous work which Victor of Capua brought to light in the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
and conjecturally assigned to Tatian, was the lost work of Ammonius,
(<hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi> p. 63, § 660,)&mdash;was of course warranted
in appealing to the authority of Ammonius <emph>in support</emph> of the last
twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel. But in truth Mill's assumption cannot be
maintained for a moment, as Wetstein has convincingly shewn.
(<hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi> p. 68.) Any one may easily satisfy himself of the
fact who will be at the pains to examine a few of the chapters with attention,
bearing in mind what Eusebius has said concerning the work of Ammonius.
Cap. lxxiv, for instance, contains as follows:&mdash;Mtt. xiii. 33, 34. Mk. iv. 33.
Mtt. xiii. 34, 35: 10, 11. Mk. iv. 34. Mtt. xiii. 13 to 17. But here it is
<emph>S. Matthew's Gospel</emph> which is dislocated,&mdash;for verses 10, 11, and 13
to 17 of ch. xiii. come <emph>after</emph> verses 33-35; while ver. 12 has
altogether disappeared.
</p>
<p>
The most convenient edition for reference is
Schmeller's,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ammonii Alexandrini
quæ et Tatiani dicitur Harmonia Evangeliorum</hi>. (Vienna, 1841.)
</p></note>&mdash;if its precise
contents, if the very details of its construction, can at
this distance of time be only conjecturally ascertained,&mdash;what
right has any one to appeal to <q><emph>the Sections of Ammonius</emph>,</q>
as to a known document? Why above all do
Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest deliberately claim <q>Ammonius</q>
for their ally on an occasion like the present;
seeing that they must needs be perfectly well aware that
they have no means whatever of knowing (except from the
precarious evidence of Catenæ) what Ammonius thought
about any single verse in any of the four Gospels? At every
stage of this discussion, I am constrained to ask myself,&mdash;Do
then the recent Editors of the Text of the New Testament
really suppose that their statements will <emph>never</emph> be examined?
their references <emph>never</emph> verified? or is it thought
that they enjoy a monopoly of the learning (such as it is)
which enables a man to form an opinion in this department
of sacred Science? For,
</p>

<p>
(1st.) <emph>Where</emph> then and <emph>what</emph> are those <q>Sections of
Ammonius</q> to which Tischendorf and Tregelles so confidently
appeal? It is even notorious that when they <emph>say</emph> the <q>Sections
of Ammonius,</q> what they <emph>mean</emph> are the <q>Sections of
<emph>Eusebius</emph>.</q>&mdash;But, (2dly.) Where is the proof,&mdash;where is even
the probability,&mdash;that these two are identical? The Critics
cannot require to be reminded by me that we are absolutely
<pb n="130"/><anchor id="Pg130"/>
without proof that so much as <emph>one</emph> of the Sections of Ammonius
corresponded with <emph>one</emph> of those of Eusebius; and yet,
(3dly.) Who sees not that unless the Sections of Ammonius
and those of Eusebius can be proved to have corresponded
throughout, the name of Ammonius has no business whatever
to be introduced into such a discussion as the present?
They must at least be told that in the entire absence of
proof of any kind,&mdash;(and certainly nothing that Eusebius
says warrants any such inference,<note place="foot">Only by the merest license of
interpretation can εἰληφὼς ἀφορμάς be
assumed to mean that Eusebius had found the four Gospels ready divided to
his hand by Ammonius into exactly 1165 sections,&mdash;every one of which he had
simply adopted for his own. Mill, (who nevertheless held this strange opinion,)
was obliged to invent the wild hypothesis that Eusebius, <emph>besides</emph> the work
of Ammonius which he describes, must have found in the library at Cæsarea the
private copy of the Gospels which belonged to Ammonius,&mdash;an unique volume,
in which the last-named Father (as he assumes) will have numbered the Sections
and made them exactly 1165. It is not necessary to discuss such a notion.
We are dealing with facts,&mdash;not with fictions.</note>)&mdash;to reason from the
one to the other as if they were identical, is what no sincere
inquirer after Truth is permitted to do.
</p>

<p>
It is time, however, that I should plainly declare that it
happens to be no matter of opinion at all whether the lost
Sections of Ammonius were identical with those of Eusebius
or not. It is demonstrable that they <emph>cannot</emph> have been so;
and the proof is supplied by the Sections themselves. It is
discovered, by a careful inspection of them, that they <emph>imply</emph>
and <emph>presuppose the Ten Canons</emph>; being in many places even
meaningless,&mdash;nugatory, in fact, (I do not of course say
that they are <emph>practically</emph> without <emph>use</emph>,)&mdash;except
on the theory that those Canons were already in existence.<note place="foot">For proofs
of what is stated above, as well as for several remarks on the
(so-called) <q>Ammonian</q> Sections, the reader is referred to the
<ref target="Appendix_G">Appendix (G)</ref>.</note> Now the
Canons are confessedly the invention of Eusebius. He distinctly
claims them.<note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg128">128</ref>, note
(f).</note> Thus much then concerning the supposed
testimony of Ammonius. It is <emph>nil</emph>.&mdash;And now for
what is alleged concerning the evidence of Eusebius.
</p>

<p>
The starting-point of this discussion, (as I began by remarking),
is the following memorandum found in certain
ancient MSS.:&mdash;<q>Thus far did Eusebius canonize;</q><note place="foot">See above,
p. <ref target="Pg125">125</ref>.</note> which
<pb n="131"/><anchor id="Pg131"/>
means either: (1) That his Canons recognise no section of
S. Mark's Gospel subsequent to § 233, (which number is
commonly set over against ver. 8:) or else, (which comes to
the same thing,)&mdash;(2) That no sections of the same Gospel,
after § 233, are referred to any of his X Canons.
</p>

<p>
On this slender foundation has been raised the following
precarious superstructure. It is assumed,
</p>

<p>
(1st.) That the Section of S. Mark's Gospel which Eusebius
numbers <q>233,</q> and which begins at our ver. 8, <emph>cannot have
extended beyond</emph> ver. 8;&mdash;whereas it may have extended, and
probably did extend, down to the end of ver. 11.
</p>

<p>
(2dly.) That because no notice is taken in the Eusebian
Canons of any sectional <emph>number</emph> in S. Mark's Gospel subsequent
to § 233, no <emph>Section</emph> (with, or without, such a subsequent
number) can have existed:&mdash;whereas there may
have existed one or more subsequent Sections all duly numbered.<note place="foot">As
a matter of fact, Codices abound in which the Sections are noted <emph>without</emph>
the Canons, throughout. See more on this subject in the
<ref target="Appendix_G">Appendix (G)</ref>.</note>
This notwithstanding, Eusebius, (according to the
memorandum found in certain ancient MSS.), may have
<emph>canonized</emph> no further than § 233.
</p>

<p>
I am not disposed, however, to contest the point as far as
Eusebius is concerned. I have only said so much in order
to shew how unsatisfactory is the argumentation on the
other side. Let it be assumed, for argument sake, that the
statement <q>Eusebius canonized no farther than ver. 8</q> is
equivalent to this,&mdash;<q><emph>Eusebius numbered no Sections after
ver.</emph> 8;</q> (and more it cannot mean:)&mdash;What <emph>then</emph>? I am at
a loss to see what it is that the Critics propose to themselves
by insisting on the circumstance. For we knew before,&mdash;it
was in fact Eusebius himself who told us,&mdash;that Copies
of the Gospel ending abruptly at ver. 8, were anciently of
frequent occurrence. Nay, we heard the same Eusebius remark
that one way of shelving a certain awkward problem
would be, to plead that the subsequent portion of
S. Mark's Gospel is frequently wanting. What <emph>more</emph> have we
learned when we have ascertained that the same Eusebius
allowed no place to that subsequent portion in his Canons?
The new fact, (supposing it to be a fact,) is but the correlative
<pb n="132"/><anchor id="Pg132"/>
of the old one; and since it was Eusebius who was the
voucher for <emph>that</emph>, what additional probability do we establish
that the inspired autograph of S. Mark ended abruptly
at ver. 8, by discovering that Eusebius is consistent with
himself, and omits to <q>canonize</q> (or even to <q>sectionize</q>)
what he had already hypothetically hinted might as well be
left out altogether? (See above, pp. <ref target="Pg044">44-6</ref>.)
</p>

<p>
So that really I am at a loss to see that one atom of progress
is made in this discussion by the further discovery
that, (in a work written about <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 373,)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Epiphanius</hi>
</p>

<p>
states casually that <q>the four Gospels contain 1162
sections.</q><note place="foot">τέσσαρα εἰσιν εὐαγγέλια κεφαλαίων χιλίων ἑκατὸν
ἑξηκονταδύο. The words are most unexpectedly, (may I not say
<emph>suspiciously</emph>?), found in Epiphanius, <hi rend='italic'>Ancor.</hi> 50,
(<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 54 <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>.)</note>
From this it is argued<note place="foot">By Tischendorf, copying Mill's
<hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi> p. 63, § 662:&mdash;the fontal source,
by the way, of the twin references to <q>Epiphanius and Cæsarius.</q></note>
that since 355 of these are commonly assigned to S. Matthew, 342 to S. Luke, and
232 to S. John, there do but remain for S. Mark 233; and
the 233rd section of S. Mark's Gospel confessedly begins at
ch. xvi. 8.&mdash;The probability may be thought to be thereby
slightly increased that the sectional numbers of Eusebius
extended no further than ver. 8: but&mdash;Has it been rendered
one atom more probable that the inspired Evangelist himself
ended his Gospel abruptly at the 8th verse? <emph>That</emph> fact&mdash;(the
<emph>only</emph> thing which our opponents have to establish)&mdash;remains
exactly where it was; entirely unproved, and in the
highest degree improbable.
</p>

<p>
To conclude, therefore. When I read as follows in the
pages of Tischendorf:&mdash;<q>These verses are not recognised by
the Sections of Ammonius, nor by the Canons of Eusebius:
Epiphanius and Cæsarius bear witness to the fact;</q>&mdash;I am
constrained to remark that the illustrious Critic has drawn
upon his imagination for three of his statements, and that
the fourth is of no manner of importance.
</p>

<p>
(1.) About the <q>Sections of Ammonius,</q> he really knows
no more than about the lost Books of Livy. He is, therefore,
without excuse for adducing them in the way of evidence.
</p>

<pb n="133"/><anchor id="Pg133"/>

<p>
(2.) That Epiphanius bears no witness whatever either
as to the <q>Sections of Ammonius</q> or to <q>Canons of Eusebius,</q>
Tischendorf is perfectly well aware. So is my reader.
</p>

<p>
(3.) His appeal to
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Cæsarius</hi>
</p>

<p>
is worse than infelicitous. He intends thereby to designate
the younger brother of Gregory of Nazianzus; an eminent
physician of Constantinople, who died <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 368; and who,
(as far as is known,) <emph>never wrote anything</emph>. A work called
Πεύσεις, (which in the x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century
was attributed to Cæsarius, but concerning which nothing is certainly known except
that Cæsarius was certainly <emph>not</emph> its author,) is the composition
to which Tischendorf refers. Even the approximate
date of this performance, however, has never been
ascertained. And yet, if Tischendorf had condescended to
refer to it, (instead of taking his reference at second-hand,)
he would have seen at a glance that the entire context in
which the supposed testimony is found, <emph>is nothing else but
a condensed paraphrase of that part of Epiphanius</emph>, in which
the original statement occurs.<note place="foot">Comp. Epiph.
(<hi rend='italic'>Ancor.</hi> 50,) <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 53
<hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi> to 55 <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>, with Galland.
<hi rend='italic'>Bibl.</hi> vi. 26 <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi> to 27
<hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Thus much, then, for the supposed evidence of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>,
of <hi rend="smallcaps">Epiphanius</hi>, and of <hi rend="smallcaps">Cæsarius</hi> on
the subject of the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel. It is exactly
<emph>nil</emph>. In fact Pseudo-Cæsarius, so far from <q>bearing witness to the
fact</q> that the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel are
spurious, <emph>actually quotes the 16<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
verse as genuine</emph>.<note place="foot">Galland. <hi rend='italic'>Bibl.</hi>
vi. 147 <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>.</note>
</p>

<p>
(4.) As for Eusebius, nothing whatever has been added
to what we knew before concerning his probable estimate
of these verses.
</p>

<p>
IV. We are now at liberty to proceed to the only head
of external testimony which remains undiscussed. I allude
to the evidence of
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">The Catenæ</hi>.
</p>

<p>
<q>In the Catenæ on Mark,</q> (crisply declares Dr. Davidson,)
<q>there is no explanation of this section.</q><note place="foot">Vol. i. 165 (ii.
112).&mdash;It it only fair to add that Davidson is not alone in
this statement. In substance, it has become one of the common-places of those
who undertake to prove that the end of S. Mark's Gospel is spurious.</note>
<pb n="134"/><anchor id="Pg134"/>
<q>The Catenæ on Mark:</q> as if they were quite common
things,&mdash;<q>plenty, as blackberries!</q> But,&mdash;<emph>Which</emph> of <q>the
Catenæ</q> may the learned Critic be supposed to have examined?
</p>

<p>
1. Not the Catena which Possinus found in the library of
Charles de Montchal, Abp. of Toulouse, and which forms
the basis of his Catena published at Rome in 1673; because
<emph>that</emph> Codex is expressly declared by the learned Editor to be
defective from ver. 8 to the end.<note place="foot">See Possini
<hi rend='italic'>Cat.</hi> p. 363.</note>
</p>

<p>
2. Not the Catena which Corderius transcribed from the
Vatican Library and communicated to Possinus; because
in <emph>that</emph> Catena the 9th and 12th verses are distinctly commented
on.<note place="foot">Ἐφάνη πρῶτον Μαρίᾳ τῇ Μαγδαληνῇ. [= ver. 9] ταύτην Εὐσέβιος ἐν τοῖς
πρὸς Μαρῖνον ἑτέραν λέγει Μαρίαν παρὰ τὴν θεασαμένην τὸν νεανίσκον. ἥ καὶ
ἀμφότεραι ἐκ τῆς Μαγδαληνῆς ἢσαν. μετὰ δὲ ταῦτα δυσὶν ἐξ αὐτῶν περιπατοῦσι.
καὶ τὰ ἑξῆς [= ver. 12.] τοὺς ἀμφὶ τὸν Κλέοπαν, καθὼς ὁ Λουκᾶς ἱστορεῖ, (Possini
sini <hi rend='italic'>Cat.</hi> p. 364):&mdash;Where it will be seen that
<emph>Text</emph> (κείμενον) and <emph>Interpretation</emph>
(ἑρμηνεία) are confusedly thrown together. <q>Anonymus [Vaticanus]</q>
also quotes S. Mark xvi. 9 at p. 109, <hi rend='italic'>ad fin.</hi>&mdash;Matthaei
(N.T. ii. 269),&mdash;overlooking the fact that <q><hi rend='italic'>Anonymus
Vaticanus</hi></q> (or simply <q><hi rend='italic'>Anonymus</hi></q>) and
<q><hi rend='italic'>Anonymus Tolosanus</hi></q> (or simply
<q><hi rend='italic'>Tolosanus</hi></q>) denote two distinct Codices,&mdash;falls
into a mistake himself while contradicting our learned countryman Mill,
who says,&mdash;<q>Certe Victor Antioch. ac Anonymus Tolosanues huc usque [sc.
ver. 8] nec ultra commentantur.</q>&mdash;Scholz' dictum is,&mdash;<q>Commentatorum qui
in catenis SS. Petrum ad Marcum laudantur, nulla explicatio hujus pericopæ
exhibetur.</q></note>
</p>

<p>
3. Still less can Dr. Davidson be thought to have inspected
the Catena commonly ascribed to Victor of Antioch,&mdash;which
Peltanus published in Latin in 1580, but which Possinus
was the first to publish in Greek (1673). Dr. Davidson,
I say, cannot certainly have examined <emph>that</emph> Catena; inasmuch
as it contains, (as I have already largely shewn, and,
in fact, as every one may see,) a long and elaborate dissertation
on the best way of reconciling the language of S. Mark
in ver. 9 with the language of the other Evangelists.<note place="foot">See above
pp. <ref target="Pg062">62-3</ref>. The Latin of Peltanus may be seen in such Collections
as the <hi rend='italic'>Magna Bibliotheca Vett. PP.</hi> (1618,) vol. iv. p. 330,
col. 2 <hi rend="smallcaps">E, F</hi>.&mdash;For the Greek, see Possini
<hi rend='italic'>Catena</hi>, pp. 359-61.</note>
</p>

<p>
4. Least of all is it to be supposed that the learned Critic
has inspected either of the last two editions of the same
<pb n="135"/><anchor id="Pg135"/>
Catena: viz. that of Matthaei, (Moscow 1775,) or that of
Cramer, (Oxford 1844,) from MSS. in the Royal Library
at Paris and in the Bodleian. This is simply impossible,
because (as we have seen), in <emph>these</emph> is contained the famous
passage <emph>which</emph> categorically asserts the genuineness of the
last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel.<note place="foot">See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg064">64-5</ref>, and <ref target="Appendix_E">Appendix (E)</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
Now this exhausts the subject.
</p>

<p>
To <emph>which</emph>, then, of <q>the Catenæ on Mark,</q> I must again
inquire, does this learned writer allude?&mdash;I will venture to
answer the question myself; and to assert that this is only
one more instance of the careless, second-hand (and third-rate)
criticism which is to be met with in every part of
Dr. Davidson's book: one proof more of the alacrity with
which worn-out objections and worthless arguments are furbished
up afresh, and paraded before an impatient generation
and an unlearned age, whenever (<hi rend='italic'>tanquam vile corpus</hi>) the
writings of Apostles or Evangelists are to be assailed, or the
Faith of the Church of <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi> is to be unsettled and
undermined.
</p>

<p>
V. If the Reader will have the goodness to refer back to
p. <ref target="Pg039">39</ref>, he will perceive that I have now disposed of every
witness whom I originally undertook to examine. He will
also, in fairness, admit that there has not been elicited one
particle of evidence, from first to last, which renders it in
the slightest degree probable that the Gospel of S. Mark, as
it originally came from the hands of its inspired Author,
was either an imperfect or an unfinished work. Whether
there have not emerged certain considerations which render
such a supposition in the highest degree <emph>un</emph>likely,&mdash;I am
quite content that my Reader shall decide.
</p>

<p>
Dismissing the external testimony, therefore, proceed we
now to review those internal evidences, which are confidently
appealed to as proving that the concluding Verses
of S. Mark's Gospel cannot be regarded as really the work
of the Evangelist.

<p>
A distinct class of objections remains to be considered.
An argument much relied on by those who deny or doubt
the genuineness of this portion of S. Mark's Gospel, is derived
from considerations of internal evidence. In the judgment
of a recent Editor of the New Testament,&mdash;These
twelve verses <q>bear traces of <emph>another hand</emph> from that which
has shaped the <emph>diction</emph> and <emph>construction</emph> of the rest of the
Gospel.</q><note place="foot">Alford on S. Mark xvi. 9-20.</note> They are therefore
<q>an addition to the narrative,</q>&mdash;of which <q>the internal evidence will be
found to preponderate vastly against the authorship of Mark.</q>&mdash;<q>A
difference,</q> (says Dr. Tregelles,) <q>has been remarked, and
truly remarked, between <emph>the phraseology</emph> of this section and
the rest of this Gospel.</q>&mdash;According to Dr. Davidson,&mdash;<q>The
<emph>phraseology and style</emph> of the section are unfavourable
to its authenticity.</q> <q>The characteristic peculiarities which
pervade Mark's Gospel do not appear in it; but, on the contrary,
terms and expressions,</q> <q>phrases and words, are introduced
which Mark never uses; or terms for which he
employs others.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. ii.
p. 113.</note>&mdash;So Meyer,&mdash;<q>With ver. 9, we suddenly
come upon an excerpting process totally different from the
previous mode of narration. The passage contains none of
Mark's peculiarities (no εὐθέως, no πάλιν, &amp;c, but the baldness
<pb n="137"/><anchor id="Pg137"/>
and lack of clearness which mark a compiler;) while in
single expressions, it is altogether contrary to Mark's manner.</q>&mdash;<q>There
is</q> (says Professor Norton) <q>a difference so
great between the use of language in this passage, and its
use in the undisputed portion of Mark's Gospel, as to furnish
strong reasons for believing the passage not genuine.</q>&mdash;No
one, however, has expressed himself more strongly on this subject
than Tischendorf. <q>Singula</q> (he says) <q>multifariam a
Marci ratione abhorrent.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> Ed.
8<hi rend="vertical-align: super">va</hi> i. p. 406.</note>... Here, then, is something
very like a consensus of hostile opinion: although the terms of the

of <q>Terms and Expressions,</q>&mdash;difference of <q>Words

peculiarities.</q> I suppose, however, that all may be brought
under two heads,&mdash;(I.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Style</hi>, and (II.)
<hi rend="smallcaps">Phraseology</hi>: meaning
by <q>Style</q> whatever belongs to the Evangelist's manner;
and by <q>Phraseology</q> whatever relates to the words
and expressions he has employed. It remains, therefore,
that we now examine the proofs by which it is proposed to
substantiate these confident assertions, and ascertain exactly
what they are worth by constant appeals to the Gospel.
Throughout this inquiry, we have to do not with Opinion
but with Fact. The unsupported dicta of Critics, however
distinguished, are entitled to no manner of attention.
</p>

<p>
1. In the meantime, as might have been expected, these
confident and often-repeated asseverations have been by no
means unproductive of mischievous results:
</p>

<lg>
<l>Like ceaseless droppings, which at last are known</l>
<l>To leave their dint upon the solid stone.</l>
</lg>

<p>
I observe that Scholars and Divines of the best type (as
the Rev. T. S. Green<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Developed Crit.</hi> pp.
51-2.</note>) at last put up with them. The wisest
however reproduce them under protest, and with apology.
The names of Tischendorf and Tregelles, Meyer and Davidson,
command attention. It seems to be thought incredible
that they can <emph>all</emph> be <emph>entirely</emph> in the wrong. They impose
upon learned and unlearned readers alike. <q>Even Barnabas
<pb n="138"/><anchor id="Pg138"/>
has been carried away with their dissimulation.</q> He has
(to my surprise and regret) two suggestions:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) The one,&mdash;That this entire section of the second
Gospel may possibly have been written long after the rest;
and that therefore its verbal peculiarities need not perplex
or trouble us. It was, I suppose, (according to this learned
and pious writer,) a kind of after-thought, or supplement,
or Appendix to S. Mark's Gospel. In this way I have seen
the last Chapter of S. John once and again accounted for.&mdash;To
which, it ought to be a sufficient answer to point out
that there is <emph>no appearance whatever</emph> of any such interval
having been interposed between S. Mark xvi. 8 and 9: that
it is highly improbable that any such interval occurred:
and that until the <q>verbal peculiarities</q> have been ascertained
to exist, it is, to say the least, a gratuitous exercise of
the inventive faculty to discover reasons for their existence.
Whether there be not something radically unsound and
wrong in all such conjectures about <q>after-thoughts,</q> <q>supplements,</q>
<q>appendices,</q> and <q>second editions</q> when the
everlasting Gospel of <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus Christ</hi> is the thing spoken
of,&mdash;a confusing of things heavenly with things earthly which
must make the Angels weep,&mdash;I forbear to press on the present
occasion. It had better perhaps be discussed at another
opportunity. But φίλοι ἄνδρες<note place="foot">ἀμφοῖν γὰρ ὄντων φίλοιν, ὅσιον
προτιμᾶν τὴν ἀλήθειαν.&mdash;Arist. <hi rend='italic'>Eth. Nic.</hi>
I. iii.</note> will forgive my freedom in
having already made my personal sentiment on the subject
sufficiently plain.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) His other suggestion is,&mdash;That this portion may not
have been penned by S. Mark himself after all. By which
he clearly means no more than this,&mdash;that as we are content
not to know <emph>who</emph> wrote the conclusion of the Books of
Deuteronomy and Joshua, so, if needful, we may well be
content not to know who wrote the end of the Gospel of
S. Mark.&mdash;In reply to which, I have but to say, that after
cause has been shewn why we should indeed believe that not
S. Mark but some one else wrote the end of S. Mark's Gospel,
we shall be perfectly willing to acquiesce in the new
fact:&mdash;but <emph>not till then</emph>.
</p>

<pb n="139"/><anchor id="Pg139"/>

<p>
2. True indeed it is that here and there a voice has been
lifted up in the way of protest<note place="foot">To the honour of the Rev. F. H.
Scrivener be it said, that <emph>he</emph> at least absolutely refuses to pay any
attention at all <q>to the argument against these twelve verses arising from their
alleged difference in style from the rest of the Gospel.</q> See by all means his
remarks on this subject. (<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, pp. 431-2.)&mdash;One
would have thought that a recent controversy concerning a short English
Poem,&mdash;which some able men were confident <emph>might</emph> have
been written by Milton, while others were just as confident that it could not
possibly be his,&mdash;ought to have opened the eyes of all to the precarious nature
of such Criticism.</note> against the proposed inference
from the familiar premisses; (for the self-same statements
have now been so often reproduced, that the eye grows
weary at last of the ever-recurring string of offending vocables:)&mdash;but,
with <emph>one</emph> honorable exception,<note place="foot"><p>Allusion is made to
the Rev. John A. Broadus, D.D.,&mdash;<q>Professor of Interpretation of the New
Testament in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Greenville, S.C.,</q>&mdash;the
author of an able and convincing paper entitled <q>Exegetical Studies</q> in
<q><hi rend='italic'>The Baptist Quarterly</hi></q> for July, 1869
(Philadelphia), pp. 355-62: in which <q>the words and phrases</q> contained in
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 are exclusively examined.
</p>
<p>
If the present volume should ever reach the learned Professor's hands, he will
perceive that I must have written the present Chapter <emph>before</emph> I knew of his
labours: (an advantage which I owe to Mr. Scrivener's kindness:) my treatment
of the subject and his own being so entirely different. But it is only
due to Professor Broadus to acknowledge the interest and advantage with
which I have compared my lucubrations with his, and the sincere satisfaction
with which I have discovered that we have everywhere independently
arrived at precisely the same result.
</p></note> men do not seem
to have ever thought of calling the premisses themselves in
question: examining the statements one by one: contesting
the ground inch by inch: refusing absolutely to submit to
any dictation whatever in this behalf: insisting on bringing
the whole matter to the test of severe inquiry, and making
every detail the subject of strict judicial investigation. This
is what I propose to do in the course of the present Chapter.
I altogether deny the validity of the inference which has
been drawn from <q>the style,</q> <q>the phraseology,</q> <q>the diction</q>
of the present section of the Gospel. But I do more.
I entirely deny the accuracy of almost <emph>every individual statement</emph>
from which the unfavourable induction is made, and the
hostile inference drawn. Even <emph>this</emph> will not nearly satisfy
<pb n="140"/><anchor id="Pg140"/>
me. I insist that one only result can attend the exact
analysis of this portion of the Gospel into its elements;
namely, a profound conviction that S. Mark is most certainly
its Author.
</p>

<p>
3. Let me however distinctly declare beforehand that
remarks on <q>the style</q> of an Evangelist are singularly
apt to be fallacious, especially when (as here) it is proposed
to apply them to a very limited portion of the sacred narrative.
Altogether to be mistrusted moreover are they, when
(as on the present occasion) it is proposed to make them
the ground for possibly rejecting such a portion of Scripture
as spurious. It becomes a fatal objection to such reasoning
that <emph>the style</emph> may indeed be exceedingly diverse, and yet
<emph>the Author</emph> be confessedly one and the same. How exceedingly
dissimilar in style are the Revelation of S. John and
the Gospel of S. John! Moreover, practically, the promised
remarks on <q>style,</q> when the Authorship of some portion
of Scripture is to be discussed, are commonly observed to
degenerate at once into what is really quite a different thing.
Single words, perhaps some short phrase, is appealed to,
which (it is said) does not recur in any part of the same
book; and thence it is argued that the Author can no longer
be the same. <q>According to this argument, <emph>the recurrence
of the same words</emph> constitutes identity of style; the want
of such recurrence implies difference of style;&mdash;difference
of style in such a sense as compels us to infer diversity of
authorship. Each writer is supposed to have at his disposal
a limited number of <q>formulæ</q> within the range of which
he must work. He must in each chapter employ these
formulæ, and these only. He must be content with one
small portion of his mother-tongue, and not dare to venture
across the limits of that portion,&mdash;on pain of losing his
identity.</q><note place="foot">Dr. Kay's <hi rend='italic'>Crisis Hupfeldiana</hi>,
p. 34,&mdash;the most masterly and instructive
exposure of Bp. Colenso's incompetence and presumption which has ever appeared.
Intended specially of <emph>his</emph> handling of the writings of Moses, the
remarks in the text are equally applicable to much which has been put forth
concerning the authorship of the end of S. Mark's Gospel.</note>
</p>

<p>
4. How utterly insecure must be every approximation to
<pb n="141"/><anchor id="Pg141"/>
such a method of judging about the Authorship of any
twelve verses of Scripture which can be named, scarcely
requires illustration. The attentive reader of S. Matthew's
Gospel is aware that a mode of expression which is <emph>six times
repeated</emph> in his viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> and
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapters is perhaps only once
met with besides in his Gospel,&mdash;viz. in his
xxi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi> chapter.<note place="foot">S. Matth. viii.
1 (καταβάντι αὐτῷ):&mdash;5 (εἰσελθόντι τω Ἰ.):&mdash;23 (ἐμβάντι αὐτῷ):&mdash;28
(ἐλθόντι αὐτῷ):&mdash;ix. 27 (παράγοντι τῷ Ἰ.):&mdash;28 (ἐλθόντι):&mdash;xxi. 23
(ἐλθόντι αὐτῷ).</note> The <q>style</q> of the 17th verse of his
i<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi> chapter may be
thought unlike anything else in S. Matthew. S. Luke's five
opening verses are unique, both in respect of manner and
of matter. S. John also in his five opening verses seems to
me to have adopted a method which is not recognisable
anywhere else in his writings; <q>rising strangely by degrees,</q>
(as Bp. Pearson expresses it,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>On the Creed</hi>,
Art. ii. (vol. i. p. 155.)</note>) <q>making the last
word of the former sentence the first of that which
followeth.</q>&mdash;<q><emph>He</emph> knoweth that he saith true,</q> is the language
of the same Evangelist concerning himself in chap. xix. 35.
But, <q><emph>we</emph> know that his testimony is true,</q> is his phrase in
chap. xxi. 24. Twice, and twice only throughout his Gospel,
(viz. in chap. xix. 35: xx. 31), is he observed to address his
readers, and on both occasions in the same words: (<q>that
<emph>ye</emph> may believe.</q>) But what of all this? Is it to be supposed
that S. Matthew, S. Luke, S. John are not the authors
of those several places? From facts like these no inference
whatever is to be drawn as to the genuineness or the spuriousness
of a writing. It is quite to mistake the Critic's
vocation to imagine that he is qualified, or called upon, to
pass any judgment of the sort.
</p>

<p>
5. I have not said all this, of course, as declining the proposed
investigation. I approach it on the contrary right
willingly, being confident that it can be attended by only
one result. With what is true, endless are the harmonies
which evolve themselves: from what is false, the true is
equally certain to stand out divergent.<note place="foot">τῷ μὲν γὰρ ἀληθεῖ πάντα
συνᾴδει τὰ ὑπάρχοντα, τῷ δὲ ψευδεῖ ταχὺ διαφωνεῖ
τὰληθές. Aristot. <hi rend='italic'>Eth. Nic.</hi> I. c. vi.</note> And we all desire
nothing but the Truth.
</p>

<pb n="142"/><anchor id="Pg142"/>

<p>
I. To begin then with the <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Style and manner</hi></q> of
S. Mark in this place.
</p>

<p>
1. We are assured that <q>instead of the <emph>graphic, detailed</emph>
description by which this Evangelist is distinguished, we
meet with an abrupt, sententious manner, resembling that
of brief notices extracted from larger accounts and loosely
linked together.</q><note place="foot">Davidson's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
&amp;c. i. 170.</note> Surely if this be so, the only lawful
inference would be that S. Mark, in this place, <emph>has</emph> <q>extracted
brief notices from larger accounts, and loosely linked
them together:</q> and unless such a proceeding on the part
of the Evangelist be judged incredible, it is hard to see
what is the force of the adverse criticism, as directed against
the <emph>genuineness</emph> of the passage now under consideration.
</p>

<p>
2. But in truth, (when divested of what is merely a gratuitous
assumption,) the preceding account of the matter
is probably not far from the correct one. Of S. Mark's
practice of making <q><emph>extracts</emph>,</q> I know nothing: nor Dr.
Davidson either. That there existed <emph>any</emph> <q>larger accounts</q>
which would have been available for such a purpose, (except
the Gospel according to S. Matthew,) there is neither a particle
of evidence, nor a shadow of probability. On the other
hand, that, notwithstanding the abundant oral information
to which confessedly he had access, S. Mark has been divinely
guided in this place to handle, in the briefest manner,
some of the chiefest things which took place after our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
Resurrection,&mdash;is simply undeniable. And without at all
admitting that the style of the Evangelist is in consequence
either <q>abrupt</q> or <q>sententious,</q><note place="foot">And yet, if it were ever
so <q>sententious,</q> ever so <q>abrupt;</q> and if his <q>brief notices</q> were
over so <q>loosely linked together;</q>&mdash;these, <emph>according to Dr.
Davidson</emph>, would only be indications that S. Mark actually <emph>was</emph> their
Author. Hear him discussing S. Mark's <q>characteristics,</q> at p. 151:&mdash;<q>In
the consecution of his narrations, Mark <emph>puts them together very loosely</emph>.</q>
<q>Mark is also characterised by a <emph>conciseness</emph> and apparent incompleteness
of delineation which are allied to the obscure.</q> <q>The <emph>abrupt</emph>
introduction</q> of many of his details is again and again appealed to by Dr. Davidson,
and illustrated by references to the Gospel. What, in the name of common sense,
is the value of such criticism as this? What is to be thought of a gentleman
who blows hot and cold in the same breath: denying at p. 170 the genuineness
of a certain portion of Scripture <emph>because</emph> it exhibits the very peculiarities
which at p. 151 he had volunteered the information are <emph>characteristic</emph> of
its reputed Author?</note> I yet recognise the
<pb n="143"/><anchor id="Pg143"/>
inevitable consequence of relating many dissimilar things
within very narrow limits; namely, that the transition from
one to the other forces itself on the attention. What wonder
that the same phenomenon should <emph>not</emph> be discoverable in
other parts of the Gospel where the Evangelist is <emph>not</emph> observed
to be doing the same thing?
</p>

<p>
3. But wherever in his Gospel S. Mark <emph>is</emph> doing the same
thing, he is observed to adopt the style and manner which
Dr. Davidson is pleased to call <q>sententious</q> and <q>abrupt.</q>
Take twelve verses in his first chapter, as an example.
Between S. Mark xvi. 9-20 and S. Mark i. 9-20, I profess
myself unable to discern any real difference of style. I proceed
to transcribe the passage which I deliberately propose
for comparison; <emph>the twelve corresponding verses</emph>, namely, in
S. Mark's <emph>first</emph> chapter, which are to be compared with the
twelve verses already under discussion, from his <emph>last</emph>; and
they may be just as conveniently exhibited in English as
in Greek:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'><hi rend="smallcaps">S. Mark</hi></hi> i. 9-20.)
</p>

<p>
(ver. 9.) <q>And it came to pass in those days, that <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John
in Jordan. (10.) And straightway coming up out of the
water, He saw the heavens opened, and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Spirit</hi> like
a dove descending upon Him: (11.) and there came a
voice from heaven saying, Thou art My beloved <hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi>, in
whom I am well pleased. (12.) And immediately the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Spirit</hi> driveth Him into the wilderness. (13.) And He
was there in the wilderness forty days, tempted of Satan;
and was with the wild beasts; and the Angels ministered
unto Him. (14.) Now after that John was put in prison,
<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi> came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of the
kingdom of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>, (15.) and saying, The time is fulfilled,
and the Kingdom of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> is at hand: repent ye, and believe
the Gospel. (16.) Now, as He walked by the sea
of Galilee, He saw Simon and Andrew his brother casting
a net into the sea: for they were fishers. (17.) And <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>
<pb n="144"/><anchor id="Pg144"/>
said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you
to become fishers of men. (18.) And straightway they
forsook their net's, and followed Him. (19.) And when
He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in
the ship mending their nets. (20.) And straightway He
called them; and they left their father Zebedee in the
ship with the hired servants, and went after Him.</q>
</p>

<p>
4. The candid reader must needs admit that precisely the
self-same manner is recognisable in this first chapter of
S. Mark's Gospel which is asserted to be peculiar to the last.
Note, that from our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Baptism (which occupies
the first three verses) the Evangelist passes to His Temptation,
which is dismissed in two. Six months elapse. The
commencement of the Ministry is dismissed in the next two
verses. The last five describe the call of four of the Apostles,&mdash;without
any distinct allusion to the miracle which
was the occasion of it.... How was it <emph>possible</emph> that when
incidents considerable as these had to be condensed within
the narrow compass of twelve verses, the same <q>graphic,
detailed description</q> could reappear which renders S. Mark's
description of the miracle performed in the country of the
Gadarenes (for example) so very interesting; where a single
incident is spread over twenty verses, although the action
did not perhaps occupy an hour? I rejoice to observe that
<q>the <emph>abrupt transitions</emph> of this section</q> (ver. 1-13) have
also been noticed by Dean Alford: who very justly accounts
for the phenomenon by pointing out that here <q>Mark
appears as <emph>an abridger of previously well-known
facts</emph>.</q><note place="foot">N.T. vol. i. <hi rend='italic'>Prolegg.</hi> p.
38.</note> But then, I want to know what there is in this to induce us to
suspect <emph>the genuineness</emph> of either the beginning or the end of
S. Mark's Gospel?
</p>

<p>
5. For it is a mistake to speak as if <q>graphic, detailed
description</q> <emph>invariably</emph> characterise the second Gospel.
S. Mark is quite as remarkable for his practice of occasionally
exhibiting a considerable transaction in a highly
abridged form. The opening of his Gospel is singularly
concise, and altogether <emph>sudden</emph>. His account of John's preaching
<pb n="145"/><anchor id="Pg145"/>
(i. 1-8) is the shortest of all. Very concise is his account
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Baptism (ver. 9-11). The brevity
of his description of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Temptation is even
extraordinary (ver. 12, 13.)&mdash;I pass on; premising that I shall
have occasion to remind the reader by-and-by of certain
peculiarities in these same Twelve Verses, which seem to
have been hitherto generally overlooked.
</p>

<p>
II. Nothing more true, therefore, than Dr. Tregelles' admission
<q>that arguments on <emph>style</emph> are often very fallacious, and
that <emph>by themselves</emph> they prove very little. But</q> (he proceeds)
<q>when there does exist external evidence; and when internal
proofs as to style, manner, verbal expression, and connection,
are in accordance with such independent grounds of
forming a judgment; then, these internal considerations possess
very great weight.</q>
</p>

<p>
I have already shewn that there exists <emph>no</emph> such external
evidence as Dr. Tregelles supposes. And in the absence of
it, I am bold to assert that since nothing in the <q>Style</q> or
the <q>Phraseology</q> of these verses ever aroused suspicion in
times past, we have rather to be <emph>on our guard</emph> against suffering
our judgment to be warped by arguments drawn from
such precarious considerations now. As for determining
from such data the authorship of an isolated passage; asserting
or denying its genuineness for no other reason but
because it contains certain words and expressions which do
or do not occur elsewhere in the Gospel of which it forms
part;&mdash;let me again declare plainly that the proceeding is
in the highest degree uncritical. We are not competent
judges of what words an Evangelist was likely on any given
occasion to employ. We have no positive knowledge of the
circumstances under which any part of any one of the four
Gospels was written; nor the influences which determined
an Evangelist's choice of certain expressions in preference to
others. We are learners,&mdash;we <emph>can</emph> be only learners here.
But having said all this, I proceed (as already declared)
without reluctance or misgiving to investigate the several
charges which have been brought against this section of the
Gospel; charges derived from its <hi rend="smallcaps">Phraseology</hi>; and which
will be found to be nothing else but repeated assertions that
<pb n="146"/><anchor id="Pg146"/>

the week</q> (in ver. 9) <q>is remarkable</q> (he says) <q>as occurring
so soon after</q> μία σαββάτων (a precisely equivalent
expression) in ver. 2.&mdash;Yes, it is remarkable.
</p>

<p>
Scarcely more remarkable, perhaps, than that S. Luke
<emph>in the course of one and the same chapter</emph> should four times
designate the Sabbath τὸ σάββατον, and twice τὰ σάββατα:
again, twice, τὸ σάββατον,&mdash;twice, ἡ ἡμέρα τοῦ σαββάτου,&mdash;and
<pb n="147"/><anchor id="Pg147"/>
once, τὰ σάββατα.<note place="foot">S. Luke vi. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 9: xiii. 10, 14,
15, 16. S. Luke has, in fact, all the four different designations for the Sabbath
which are found in the Septuagint version of the O. T. Scriptures: for, in the
Acts (xiii. 14: xvi. 13), he twice calls it ἡ ἡμέρα τῶν σαββάτων.</note>
Or again, that S. Matthew should <emph>in one and the same chapter</emph> five
times call the Sabbath, τὰ σάβββτα, and three times, τό σάββατον.<note place="foot">S.
Matth. xii. 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12.</note> Attentive readers
will have observed that the Evangelists seem to have been
fond in this way of varying their phrase; suddenly introducing
a new expression for something which they had designated
differently just before. Often, I doubt not, this is
done with the profoundest purpose, and sometimes even with
manifest design; but the phenomenon, however we may
explain it, still remains. Thus, S. Matthew, (in his account
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Temptation,&mdash;chap. iv.,) has ὁ διάβολος in
ver. 1, and ὁ πειράζων in ver. 3, for him whom our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>
calls Σατανᾶς in ver. 10.&mdash;S. Mark, in chap. v. 2, has τὰ
μνημεῖα,&mdash;but in ver. 5, τὰ μνήματα.&mdash;S. Luke, in xxiv. 1, has
τὸ μνῆμα; but in the next verse, τὸ μνημεῗον.&mdash;Ἐπί with an
accusative twice in S. Matth. xxv. 21, 23, is twice exchanged
for ἐπί with a genitive in the same two verses: and ἔριφοϋ
(in ver. 32) is exchanged for ἐρίφια in ver. 33.&mdash;Instead of
ἄρχων τς συναγωγῆς (in S. Luke viii. 41) we read, in ver. 49,
ἀρχισυνάγωγος: and for οἱ ἀπόστολοι (in ix. 10) we find
οἱ δώδεκα in ver. 12.&mdash;Οὖς in S. Luke xxii. 50 is exchanged for
ὠτίον in the next verse.&mdash;In like manner, those whom S. Luke
calls οἱ νεώτεροι in Acts v. 6, he calls νεανίσκοι in ver. 10....
All such matters strike me as highly interesting, but not in
the least as suspicious. It surprises me a little, of course,
that S. Mark should present me with πρώτη σαββάτου (in
ver. 9) instead of the phrase μία σαββάτων, which he had
employed just above (in ver. 2.) But it does not surprise me
much,&mdash;when I observe that μία σαββάτων <emph>occurs only once
in each of the Four Gospels</emph>.<note place="foot">It occurs in S. Matth. xxviii.
1. S. Mark xvi. 2. S. Luke xxiv. 1. S. John
xx. i. 19. Besides, only in Acts xx. 7.</note> Whether surprised much or
little, however,&mdash;Am I constrained in consequence, (with
Tischendorf and the rest,) to regard this expression (πρώτη
σαββάτου) as a note of <emph>spuriousness</emph>? That is the only thing
<pb n="148"/><anchor id="Pg148"/>
I have to consider. Am I, with Dr. Davidson, to reason as
follows:&mdash;<q>πρώτη, Mark would scarcely have used. It should
have been μία, &amp;c. as is proved by Mark xvi. 2, &amp;c. The
expression could scarcely have proceeded from a Jew. It
betrays a Gentile author.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
&amp;c. i. 169.</note> Am I to reason thus?... I propose
to answer this question somewhat in detail.
</p>

<p>
(1.) That among the Greek-speaking Jews of Palestine,
in the days of the Gospel, ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτων was the established
method of indicating <q>the first day of the week,</q> is
plain, not only from the fact that the day of the Resurrection
is so designated by each of the Four Evangelists in
turn;<note place="foot">See the foregoing note.</note>
(S. John has the expression twice;) but also from
S. Paul's use of the phrase in 1 Cor. xvi. 2. It proves,
indeed, to have been the ordinary Hellenistic way of exhibiting
the vernacular idiom of Palestine.<note place="foot">See Buxtorf's
<hi rend='italic'>Lexicon Talmudicum</hi>, p. 2323.</note> The cardinal
(μία) for the ordinal (πρώτη) in this phrase was a known
Talmudic expression, which obtained also in Syriac.<note place="foot">Lightfoot
(on 1 Cor. xvi. 2) remarks concerning S. Paul's phrase κατὰ μίαν
σαββάτων,&mdash;<q>תבשב דהב [<hi rend='italic'>b'had b'shabbath</hi>,]
<q><hi rend='italic'>In the first</hi> [lit. <hi rend='italic'>one</hi>]
<hi rend='italic'>of the Sabbath</hi>,</q> would the Talmudists say.</q>&mdash;Professor
Gandell writes,&mdash;<q>in Syriac, the days of the week are similarly named. See
Bernstein [lit. <hi rend='italic'>one in the Sabbath</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>two in
the Sabbath</hi>, <hi rend='italic'>three in the Sabbath.</hi>]</q></note> Σάββατον
and σάββατα,&mdash;designations in strictness of the <emph>Sabbath-day</emph>,&mdash;had
come to be <emph>also</emph> used as designations of the
<emph>week</emph>. A reference to S. Mark xvi. 9 and S. Luke xviii. 12
establishes this concerning σάββατον: a reference to the
six places cited just now in earlier note establishes it concerning
σαββάτα. To see how indifferently the two forms (σάββατον
and σαββάτα) were employed, one has but to notice
that S. Matthew, <emph>in the course of one and the same chapter</emph>, five
times designates the Sabbath as τὰ σαββάτα, and three
times as τὸ σάββατον.<note place="foot">S. Mark xii. 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 11, 12.</note>
The origin and history of both words will be found explained in a note at the foot of
the page.<note place="foot"><p>The Sabbath-day, in the Old Testament, is invariably
תבש (<hi rend='italic'>shabbath</hi>): a word which the Greeks could not exhibit more
nearly than by the word σάββατον. The Chaldee form of this word is אתבש
(<hi rend='italic'>shabbatha:</hi>) the final א (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) being added
for emphasis, as in Abb<emph>a</emph>, Aceldam<emph>a</emph>, Bethesd<emph>a</emph>,
Ceph<emph>a</emph>, Pasch<emph>a</emph>, <hi rend='italic'>&amp;c</hi>.: and this
form,&mdash;(I owe the information to my friend Professor Gandell,)&mdash;because it
was so familiar to the people of Palestine, (who spoke Aramaic,) <emph>gave rise to
another form of the Greek name for the Sabbath</emph>,&mdash;viz.
σάββατα: which, naturally enough, attracted the article (τό) into agreement
with its own (apparently) plural form. By the Greek-speaking population
of Judæa, the Sabbath day was therefore indifferently called το σαββατον
and τα σαββατα: sometimes again, η ημερα του σαββατου, and sometimes
η ημερα των σαββατων.
</p>
<p>
Σάββατα, although plural in sound, was strictly singular in sense. (Accordingly,
it is <emph>invariably</emph> rendered <q><emph>Sabbatum</emph></q> in the Vulgate.)
Thus, in Exod. xvi. 23,&mdash;σάββατα ἀνάπαυσις ἁγία τῷ Κυρίῳ: and 25,&mdash;ἔστι γὰρ
σάββατα ἀνάπαυσις τῷ Κυρίῳ. Again,&mdash;τῇ δὲ ἡμέρα τῇ ἑβδόμη σάββατα. (Exod. xvi.
26: xxxi. 14. Levit. xxiii. 3.) And in the Gospel, what took place on <emph>one
definite Sabbath-day</emph>, is said to have occurred ἐν τοῖς σάββασι (S. Luke xiii. 10.
S. Mark xii. 1.)
</p>
<p>
It will, I believe, be invariably found that the form ἐν τοῖς σάββασι is strictly
equivalent to ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ; and was adopted for convenience in contradistinction
to ἐν τοῖς σαββάτοις (1 Chron. xxiii. 31 and 2 Chron. ii. 4) where
Sabbath <emph>days</emph> are spoken of.
</p>
<p>
It is not correct to say that in Levit. xxiii. 15 תותבש is put for <q>weeks;</q>
though the Septuagint translators have (reasonably enough) there rendered the
word ἑβδομάδας. In Levit. xxv. 8, (where the same word occurs twice,) it is
once rendered ἀναπαύσεις; once, ἑβδομάδες. Quite distinct is עובש
(<hi rend='italic'>shavooa</hi>) i.e. ἑβδομάς; nor is there any substitution of the
one word for the other. But inasmuch as the recurrence of the <emph>Sabbath-day</emph>
was what constituted <emph>a week</emph>; in other words, since the essential
feature of a week, as a Jewish division of time, was the recurrence of the Jewish
day of rest;&mdash;τὸ σάββατον or τὰ σάββατα, the Hebrew name for <emph>the day of
rest</emph>, became transferred to <emph>the week</emph>. The former designation,
(as explained in the text,) is used once by S. Mark, once by S. Luke; while the
phrase μία τῶν σαββάτων occurs in the N.T., in all, six times.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n="149"/><anchor id="Pg149"/>

<p>
(2.) Confessedly, then, a double Hebraism is before us,
which must have been simply unintelligible to Gentile readers.
Μία τῶν σαββάτων sounded as enigmatical to an ordinary
Greek ear, as <q><emph>una sabbatorum</emph></q> to a Roman. A convincing
proof, (if proof were needed,) how abhorrent to a Latin
reader was the last-named expression, is afforded by the old
Latin versions of S. Matthew xxviii. 1; where ὄψε σαββάτων,
τῇ ἐπιφωσκούση εἰς μίαν σαββάτων is invariably
rendered, <q>Vespere <emph>sabbati</emph>, quæ lucescit in <emph>prima
sabbati</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
(3.) The reader will now be prepared for the suggestion,
that when S. Mark, (who is traditionally related to have
written his Gospel <emph>at Rome</emph>,<note place="foot">So Eusebius
(<hi rend='italic'>Eccl. Hist.</hi> ii. 15), and Jerome (<hi rend='italic'>De Viris
Illust.</hi> ii. 827), on the authority of Clemens Alex. and of Papias. See also
Euseb. <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Eccl.</hi> vi. 14.&mdash;The colophon in the Syriac
Version shews that the same traditional belief prevailed in the Eastern Church.
It also finds record in the <hi rend='italic'>Synopsis Scripturæ</hi> (wrongly)
ascribed to Athanasius.</note>) varies, in ver. 9, the phrase
<pb n="150"/><anchor id="Pg150"/>
he had employed in ver. 2, he does so for an excellent and
indeed for an obvious reason. In ver. 2, he had conformed
to the prevailing usage of Palestine, and followed the example
set him by S. Matthew (xxviii. 1) in adopting the enigmatical
expression, ἡ μία σαββάτων. That this would be
idiomatically represented <emph>in Latin</emph> by the phrase <q>prima
sabbati,</q> we have already seen. In ver. 9, therefore, he is
solicitous to record the fact of the Resurrection afresh; and
<emph>this</emph> time, his phrase is observed to be <emph>the Greek equivalent
for the Latin <q>prima sabbati;</q></emph> viz. πρώτη σαββάτου. How
strictly equivalent the two modes of expression were felt to
be by those who were best qualified to judge, is singularly
illustrated by the fact that the <emph>Syriac</emph> rendering of both
places is <emph>identical</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(4.) But I take leave to point out that this substituted
phrase, instead of being a suspicious circumstance, is on the
contrary a striking note of genuineness. For do we not
recognise here, in the last chapter of the Gospel, the very
same hand which, in the first chapter of it, was careful to
inform us, just for once, that <q>Judæa,</q> is <q>a <emph>country</emph>,</q>
(ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα,)&mdash;and <q>Jordan,</q> <q>a <emph>river</emph>,</q> (ὁ Ἰορδάνης
ποταμός)?&mdash;Is not this the very man who explained to his
readers (in chap. xv. 42) that the familiar Jewish designation
for <q>Friday,</q> ἡ παρασκευή, denotes <q><emph>the day before
the Sabbath</emph>?</q><note place="foot">παρασκευὴ, ὅ ἐστι προσάββατον.&mdash;Our
E. V. <q>preparation</q> is from Augustine,&mdash;<q>Parasceue
Latine præparatio est.</q>&mdash;See Pearson's interesting note
on the word.</note>&mdash;and who was so minute in informing us (in
chap. vii. 3, 4) about certain ceremonial practices of <q>the
Pharisees and all the Jews?</q> Yet more,&mdash;Is not the self-same
writer clearly recognisable in this xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
chapter, who in chap. vi. 37 presented us with σπεκουλάτωρ (the Latin
<hi rend='italic'>spiculator</hi>) for <q>an executioner?</q> and who, in chap. xv. 39,
for <q>a <hi rend='italic'>centurion</hi>,</q> wrote&mdash;not ἑκατόνταρχος,
but&mdash;κεντυρίων?&mdash;and, in chap. xii. 42, explained that the two λεπτά
<pb n="151"/><anchor id="Pg151"/>
which the poor widow cast into the Treasury were equivalent
to κοδράντης, the Latin <hi rend='italic'>quadrans</hi>?&mdash;and in chap. vii.
4, 8, introduced the Roman measure <hi rend='italic'>sextarius</hi>, (ξέστης)?&mdash;and
who volunteered the information (in chap. xv. 16) that αὐλή is only another
designation of πραιτώριον (<hi rend='italic'>Prætorium</hi>)?&mdash;Yes.
S. Mark,&mdash;who, alone of the four Evangelists,
(in chap. xv. 21,) records the fact that Simon the Cyrenian
was <q><emph>the father of Alexander and Rufus</emph>,</q> evidently for the
sake of his <emph>Latin</emph> readers:<note place="foot">Consider Rom. xvi. 13.</note>
S. Mark,&mdash;who alone ventures
to write in Greek letters (οὐά,&mdash;chap. xv. 29,) the Latin interjection
<q><hi rend='italic'>Vah!</hi></q>&mdash;obviously because he was writing where
that exclamation was most familiar, and the force of it best
understood:<note place="foot">Townson's <hi rend='italic'>Discourses</hi>, i. 172.</note>
S. Mark,&mdash;who attends to the Roman division of the day, in relating our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> prophecy to S.
Peter:<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi></note>&mdash;S.
Mark, I say, no doubt it was who,&mdash;having conformed
himself to the precedent set him by S. Matthew and the
familiar usage of Palestine; and having written τῆς μιᾶς
σαββάτων, (which he knew would sound like <q><hi rend='italic'>una
sabbatorum</hi>,</q><note place="foot">See the Vulgate transl. of S. Mark xvi. 2
and of S. John xx. 19. In the same version, S. Luke xxiv. 1 and S. John xx. 1
are rendered <q><hi rend='italic'>una sabbati</hi>.</q></note>)
in ver. 2;&mdash;introduced, also for the benefit of his
Latin readers, the Greek equivalent for <q><hi rend='italic'>prima sabbati</hi>,</q>
(viz. πρώτη σαββάτου,) in ver. 9.&mdash;This, therefore, I repeat,
so far from being a circumstance <q><emph>unfavourable</emph> to its authenticity,</q>
(by which, I presume, the learned writer means
its <emph>genuineness</emph>), is rather corroborative of the Church's constant
belief that the present section of S. Mark's Gospel is,
equally with the rest of it, the production of S. Mark. <q>Not
only was the document intended for Gentile converts:</q>
(remarks Dr. Davidson, p. 149,) <q>but there are also appearances
of its adaptation to the use of Roman Christians in
particular.</q> Just so. And I venture to say that in the
whole of <q>the document</q> Dr. Davidson will not find a more
striking <q>appearance of its adaptation to the use of Roman
Christians,</q>&mdash;<emph>and therefore of its genuineness</emph>,&mdash;than this.
I shall have to request my reader by-and-by to accept it as
one of the most striking notes of Divine origin which these
verses contain.&mdash;For the moment, I pass on.
</p>

<pb n="152"/><anchor id="Pg152"/>

<p>
(II.) Less excusable is the coarseness of critical perception
betrayed by the next remark. It has been pointed out
as a suspicious circumstance that in ver. 9, <q>the phrase
ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτα δαιμόνια is attached to the name of
Mary Magdalene, although she had been mentioned three
times before without such appendix. It seems to have been
taken from Luke viii. 2.</q><note place="foot">Davidson's
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. i. 169, <hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1848:
(ii. 113, <hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1868.)</note>&mdash;Strange perversity, and yet
stranger blindness!
</p>

<p>
(1.) The phrase <emph>cannot</emph> have been taken from S. Luke;
because S. Luke's Gospel was written after S. Mark's. It
<emph>was</emph> not taken from S. Luke; because <emph>there</emph> ἀφ᾽ ἧς δαιμόνια
ἑπτα ἐξεληλύθει,&mdash;here, ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτα δαιμόνια
is read.
</p>

<p>
(2.) More important is it to expose the shallowness and
futility of the entire objection.&mdash;Mary Magdalene <q>had
been mentioned three times before, <emph>without such appendix</emph>.</q>
Well but,&mdash;What <emph>then</emph>? After twice (ch. xiv. 54, 66) using
the word αὐλή without any <q>appendix,</q> in the very next
chapter (xv. 16) S. Mark adds, ὅ ἐστι πραιτώριον.&mdash;The
beloved Disciple having mentioned himself without any
<q>appendix</q> in S. John xx. 7, mentions himself with a very
elaborate <q>appendix</q> in ver. 20. But what of it?&mdash;The
sister of the Blessed Virgin, having been designated in chap.
xv. 40, as Μαρία ἡ Ἰακώβου τοῦ μικροῦ καὶ Ἰωσῆ μήτηρ;
is mentioned with one half of that <q>appendix,</q> (Μαρία ἡ
Ἰωσῆ) in ver. 47, and <emph>in the very next verse</emph>, with the other
half (Μαρία ἡ τοῦ Ἰακώβου.)&mdash;I see no reason why the
Traitor, who, in S. Luke vi. 16, is called Ἰούδας Ἰσκαριώτης,
should be designated as Ἰούδαν τὸν ἐπικαλούμενον Ἰσκαριώτην
in S. Luke xxii. 3.&mdash;I am not saying that such <q>appendices</q>
are either uninteresting or unimportant. That
I attend to them habitually, these pages will best evince.
I am only insisting that to infer from such varieties of expression
that a different author is recognisable, is abhorrent
to the spirit of intelligent Criticism.
</p>

<p>
(3.) But in the case before us, the hostile suggestion is peculiarly
infelicitous. There is even inexpressible tenderness
and beauty, the deepest Gospel significancy, in the reservation
<pb n="153"/><anchor id="Pg153"/>
of the clause <q>out of whom He had cast seven devils,</q>
for this place. The reason, I say, is even obvious why an
<q>appendix,</q> which would have been meaningless before, is
introduced in connexion with Mary Magdalene's august
privilege of being the first of the human race to behold
the risen <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>. Jerome (I rejoice to find) has been
beforehand with me in suggesting that it was done, in order
to convey by an example the tacit assurance that <q>where
Sin had abounded, there did Grace much more abound.</q><note place="foot"><q>Maria
Magdalene ipsa est <q>a quâ septem dæmonia expulerat</q>: <emph>ut ubi
abundaverat peccatum, superabundant gratiæ</emph>.</q> (Hieron.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. 327.)</note>
Are we to be cheated of our birthright by Critics<note place="foot">So
Tischendorf,&mdash;<q>Collatis prioribus, parum apte adduntur verba ἀφ᾽ ἦσ
ἐκβεβλήκει ε. δ.</q> (p. 322.) I am astonished to find the same remark reiterated
by most of the Critics: e.g. Rev. T. S. Green, p. 52.</note> who,
entirely overlooking a solution of the difficulty (<emph>if</emph> difficulty
it be) Divine as this, can see in the circumstance grounds
only for suspicion and cavil? Απαγε.
</p>

<p>
(III.) Take the next example.&mdash;The very form of the
<q>appendix</q> which we have been considering (ἀφ᾽ ἦς ἐκβεβλήκει
ἑπτὰ δαιμόνια) breeds offence. <q>Instead of ἐκβάλλειν
ἀπό,</q> (oracularly remarks Dr. Davidson,) <q>Mark has ἐκβάλλειν
ἐκ.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. vol. i. p.
169.</note>
</p>

<p>
Nothing of the sort, I answer. S. Mark <emph>once</emph> has ἐκβάλλειν
ἐκ,<note place="foot">viz. in chap. vii. 26.</note> and <emph>once</emph>
ἐκβάλλειν ἀπό. So has S. Matthew, (viz. in chap. vii. 4 and 5):
and so has S. Luke, (viz. in
chap. vi. 42, and in Acts xiii. 50.)&mdash;But what of all this?
<emph>Who</emph> sees not that such Criticism is simply nugatory?
</p>

<p>
(IV.) We are next favoured with the notable piece of
information that the word πορεύεσθαι, <q>never used by
S. Mark, is three times contained in this passage;</q> (viz. in
verses 10, 12 and 15.)
</p>

<p>
(1.) Yes. The uncompounded verb, never used <emph>elsewhere</emph>
by S. Mark, is found here three times. But what then?
The <emph>compounds</emph> of πορεύεσθαι are common enough in his
Gospel. Thus, short as his Gospel is, he alone has εἰσ-πορεύεσθαι,
ἐκ-πορεύεσθαι, συμ-πορεύεσθαι, παρα-πορεύεσθαι,
<emph>oftener than all the other three Evangelists put together</emph>,&mdash;viz.
twenty-four times against their nineteen: while the compound
<pb n="154"/><anchor id="Pg154"/>
προσπορεύεσθαι is <emph>peculiar to his Gospel</emph>.&mdash;I am therefore
inclined to suggest that the presence of the verb πορεύεσθαι
in these Twelve suspected Verses, instead of being an
additional element of suspicion, is rather a circumstance
slightly corroborative of their genuineness.
</p>

<p>
(2.) But suppose that the facts had been different. The
phenomenon appealed to is of even perpetual recurrence,
and may on no account be represented as <emph>suspicious</emph>. Thus,
παρουσία, a word used only by S. Matthew among the Evangelists,
is by him used four times; yet are all those four
instances found <emph>in one and the same chapter</emph>. S. Luke alone
has χαρίζεσθαι, and he has it three times: but all three
cases are met with <emph>in one and the same chapter</emph>. S. John
alone has λύπη, and he has it four times: but all the four
instances occur <emph>in one and the same chapter</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(3.) Such instances might be multiplied to almost any
extent. Out of the fifteen occasions when S. Matthew uses
the word τάλαντον, no less than fourteen occur in one
chapter. The nine occasions when S. Luke uses the word
μνᾶ all occur in one chapter. S. John uses the verb ἀνιστάναι
transitively only four times: but all four instances
of it are found in one chapter.&mdash;Now, these three words
(be it observed) are <emph>peculiar to the Gospels</emph> in which they
severally occur.
</p>

<p>
(4.) I shall of course be reminded that τάλαντον and μνᾶ
are unusual words,&mdash;admitting of no substitute in the places
where they respectively occur. But I reply,&mdash;Unless the
Critics are able to shew me <emph>which</emph> of the ordinary compounds
of πορεύεσθαι S. Mark could <emph>possibly</emph> have employed for the
uncompounded verb, in the three places which have suggested
the present inquiry, viz.:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ver. 10:&mdash;ἐκείνη πορευθεῖσα ἀπήγγειλε τοῖς μετ᾽ αυτοῦ
γενομένοις.
</p>

<p>
ver. 12:&mdash;δυσὶν ἐξ αὐτῶν ... πορευομένοις εἰς ἀγρόν.
</p>

<p>
ver. 13:&mdash;πορευθέντες εἰς τὸν κόσμον ἄπαντα, κηρύξατε
τὸ εὐαγγέλιον;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
their objection is simply frivolous, and the proposed adverse
reasoning, worthless. Such, in fact, it most certainly is; for
it will be found that πορευθεῖσα in ver. 10,&mdash;πορευομένοις in
<pb n="155"/><anchor id="Pg155"/>
ver. 12,&mdash;πορευθέντες in ver. 15,&mdash;<emph>also</emph> <q>admit of no substitute
in the places where they severally occur;</q> and therefore,
since the verb itself is one of S. Mark's favourite verbs,
not only are these three places above suspicion, but they
may be fairly adduced as indications that <emph>the same</emph> hand was
at work here which wrote all the rest of his Gospel.<note place="foot">Professor
Broadus has some very good remarks on this subject.</note>
</p>

<p>
(V.) Then further,&mdash;the phrase τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενομένοις
(in ver. 10) is noted as suspicious. <q>Though found in
the Acts (xx. 18) it <emph>never occurs in the Gospels</emph>: nor does the
word μαθηταί in this passage.</q>
</p>

<p>
(1.) The phrase οἱ μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενόμενοι occurs nowhere
in the Acts or in the Gospels, <emph>except here</emph>. But,&mdash;Why
<emph>should</emph> it appear elsewhere? or rather,&mdash;How <emph>could</emph> it? Now,
if the expression be (as it is) an ordinary, easy, and obvious
one,&mdash;<emph>wanted</emph> in this place, where it <emph>is</emph> met with;
but <emph>not</emph> met with elsewhere, simply because elsewhere it is <emph>not</emph>
wanted;&mdash;surely it is unworthy of any one calling himself
a Critic to pretend that there attaches to it the faintest
shadow of suspicion!
</p>

<p>
(2.) The essence of the phrase is clearly the expression
οἱ μετ᾽ αυτοῦ. (The aorist participle of γίνομαι, is added of
necessity to mark the persons spoken of. In no other, (certainly
in no simpler, more obvious, or more precise) way
could the followers of the risen <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> have been designated
at such a time. For had He not just now <q>overcome
the sharpness of Death</q>?) But this expression, which occurs
four times in S. Matthew and four times in S. Luke, occurs
also four times in S. Mark: viz. in chap. i. 36; ii. 25; v. 40,
<emph>and here</emph>. This, therefore, is a slightly corroborative
circumstance,&mdash;not at all a ground of suspicion.
</p>

<p>
(3.) But it seems to be implied that S. Mark, because he
mentions τοὺς μαθητάς often elsewhere in his Gospel, ought
to have mentioned them here.
</p>

<p>
(a) I answer:&mdash;He does not mention τοὺς μαθητάς nearly
so often as S. Matthew; while S. John notices them twice
as often as he does.
</p>

<p>
(b) Suppose, however, that he elsewhere mentioned them
five hundred times, because he had occasion five hundred
<pb n="156"/><anchor id="Pg156"/>
times to speak of them;&mdash;what reason would <emph>that</emph> be for his
mentioning them here, where he is <emph>not</emph> speaking of them?
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) It must be evident to any one reading the Gospel
with attention that besides οἱ μαθηταί,&mdash;(by which expression
S. Mark always designates <emph>the Twelve Apostles</emph>,)&mdash;there
was a considerable company of believers assembled together
throughout the first Easter Day.<note place="foot">Consider the little society which
was assembled on the occasion alluded to, in Acts i. 13, 14. Note also what is
clearly implied by ver. 21-6, as to the persons who were <emph>habitually</emph>
present at such gatherings.</note> S. Luke notices this
circumstance when he relates how the Women, on their
return from the Sepulchre, <q>told all these things unto the
Eleven, and <emph>to all the rest</emph>,</q> (xxiv. 9): and again when he
describes how Cleopas and his companion (δύο ἐξ αὐτῶν as
S. Luke and S. Mark call them) on their return to Jerusalem,
<q>found the Eleven gathered together, <emph>and them that
were with them</emph></q> (xxiv. 33.) But this was at least as well
known to S. Mark as it was to S. Luke. Instead, therefore,
of regarding the designation <q><emph>them that had been with Him</emph></q>
with suspicion,&mdash;are we not rather to recognise in it one
token more that the narrative in which it occurs is unmistakably
genuine? What else is this but one of those delicate
discriminating touches which indicate the hand of a great
Master; one of those evidences of minute accuracy which
stamp on a narrative the impress of unquestionable Truth?
</p>

<p>
(VI.) We are next assured by our Critic that θεᾶσθαι <q>is
unknown to Mark;</q> but it occurs twice in this section, (viz.
in ver. 11 and ver. 14.) <emph>Another</emph> suspicious circumstance!
</p>

<p>
(1.) A strange way (as before) of stating an ordinary
fact, certainly! What else is it but to assume the thing
which has to be proved? If the learned writer had said
instead, that the verb θεᾶσθαι, here twice employed by
S. Mark, occurs <emph>nowhere else</emph> in his Gospel,&mdash;he would
have acted more loyally, not to say more fairly by the
record: but then he would have been stating a strictly
ordinary phenomenon,&mdash;of no significancy, or relevancy to
the matter in hand. He is probably aware that παραβαίνειν
in like manner is to be found in two consecutive verses of
S. Matthew's Gospel; παρακούειν, twice in the course of one
<pb n="157"/><anchor id="Pg157"/>
verse: neither word being used on any other occasion <emph>either
by S. Matthew, or by any other Evangelist</emph>. The same thing
precisely is to be said of ἀναζητεῖν and ἀνταποδιδόναι, of
ἀντιπαρέρχεσθαι, and διατίθεσθαι, in S. Luke: of ἀνιστάναι
and ζωννύναι in S. John. But who ever dreamed of insinuating
that the circumstance is suspicious?
</p>

<p>
(2.) As for θεᾶσθαι, we should have reminded our Critic
that this verb, which is used seven times by S. John, and
four times by S. Matthew, is used only three times by
S. Luke, and only twice by S. Mark. And we should have respectfully
inquired,&mdash;What possible suspicion does θεᾶσθαι
throw upon the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel?
</p>

<p>
(3.) None whatever, would have been the reply. But in
the meantime Dr. Davidson hints that the verb <emph>ought</emph> to have
been employed by S. Mark in chap. ii. 14.<note place="foot">S. Luke (v. 27) has
ἐθεασατο τελώνην. S. Matthew (ix. 9) and S. Mark (ii. 14) have preferred
εἶδεν ἄνθρωπον (Λευίν τὸν τοῦ Ἀλφαίου) καθήμενον ἐπὶ τὸ τελώνιον.</note>&mdash;It is,
I presume, sufficient to point out that S. Matthew, at all events, was
not of Dr. Davidson's opinion:<note place="foot">See S. Matth. ix. 9.</note> and
I respectfully submit that the Evangelist, inasmuch as he happens to be here
<emph>writing about himself</emph>, must be allowed, just for once, to be
the better judge.
</p>

<p>
(4.) In the meantime,&mdash;Is it not perceived that θεᾶσθαι
is the very word specially required in these two places,&mdash;though
<emph>nowhere else in S. Mark's Gospel</emph>?<note place="foot">One is reminded that
S. Matthew, in like manner, carefully <emph>reserves</emph> the verb θεωρεῖν (xxvii.
55: xxviii. 1) for the contemplation of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi>
Cross and of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Sepulchre.</note> The occasion is
one,&mdash;viz. the <q>beholding</q> of the person of the risen
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>. Does not even natural piety suggest that the
uniqueness of such a <q>spectacle</q> as <emph>that</emph> might well set an Evangelist
on casting about for a word of somewhat less ordinary occurrence?
The occasion cries aloud for this very verb θεᾶσθαι;
and I can hardly conceive a more apt illustration of a
darkened eye,&mdash;a spiritual faculty perverted from its lawful
purpose,&mdash;than that which only discovers <q>a stumbling-block
and occasion of falling</q> in expressions like the present which
<q>should have been only for their wealth,</q> being so manifestly
designed for their edification.
</p>

<pb n="158"/><anchor id="Pg158"/>

<p>
(VII.) But,&mdash;(it is urged by a Critic of a very different
stamp,)&mdash;ἐθεάθη ὑπ᾽ αὐτῆς (ver. 11) <q>is a construction only
found here in the New Testament.</q>
</p>

<p>
(1.) Very likely; but what then? The learned writer has
evidently overlooked the fact that the passive θεᾶσθαι occurs
but <emph>three times</emph> in the New Testament <emph>in
all</emph>.<note place="foot">S. Matth. vi. 1: xxiii. 5. S. Mark xvi. 11.</note> S.
Matthew, on the <emph>two</emph> occasions when he employs the word, connects it with
a dative.<note place="foot">Πρὸς τὸ θεαθῆναι αὐτοῖς, (vi. 1); and τοῖς ἀνθρώποις,
(xxiii. 5).</note> What is there <emph>suspicious</emph> in the circumstance that
θεᾶσθαι ὑπό should be the construction preferred by S. Mark?
The phenomenon is not nearly so remarkable as that S. Luke,
on one solitary occasion, exhibits the phrase μὴ φοβεῖσθε
ἀπό,<note place="foot">S. Luke xii. 4.</note>&mdash;instead of making the verb govern
the accusative, as he does three times <emph>in the very next verse</emph>; and,
indeed, eleven times in the course of his Gospel. To be sure, S. Luke in
this instance is but copying S. Matthew, who <emph>also</emph> has μὴ
φοβεῖσθε ἀπό once;<note place="foot">S. Matth. x. 28.</note> and seven times makes the
verb govern an accusative. This, nevertheless, constitutes no reason
whatever for suspecting the genuineness either of S. Matth.
x. 28 or of S. Luke xii. 4.
</p>

<p>
(2.) In like manner, the phrase ἐφοβήθησαν φόβον μέγαν
will be found to occur once, and once <emph>only</emph>, in S. Mark,&mdash;once,
and once only, in S. Luke;<note place="foot">S. Mark iv. 41. S. Luke ii. 9.</note>
although S. Mark and S. Luke use the verb φοβεῖσθαι upwards of forty times. Such
facts are interesting. They may prove important. But no one
who is ever so little conversant with such inquiries will pretend
that they are in the least degree <emph>suspicious</emph>.&mdash;I pass on.
</p>

<p>
(VIII.) It is next noted as a suspicious circumstance that
ἀπιστεῖν occurs in ver. 11 and in ver. 16; but nowhere else
in the Gospels,&mdash;except in S. Luke xxiv. 11, 14.
</p>

<p>
But really, such a remark is wholly without force, as an
argument against the genuineness of the passage in which
the word is found: for,
</p>

<p>
(1.) Where else in the course of this Gospel <emph>could</emph> ἀπιστεῖν
have occurred? Now, unless some reason can be shewn why
the word <emph>should</emph>, or at least <emph>might</emph> have been employed
elsewhere, to remark upon its introduction in this place, <emph>where it
<pb n="159"/><anchor id="Pg159"/>
could scarcely be dispensed with</emph>, as a ground of suspicion, is
simply irrational. It might just as well be held to be a suspicious
circumstance, in respect of verses 3 and 4, that the
verb ἀποκυλίζειν occurs there, <emph>and there only</emph>, in this Gospel.
Nothing whatever follows from the circumstance. It is, in
fact, a point scarcely deserving of attention.
</p>

<p>
(2.) To be sure, if the case of a verb exclusively used by
the two Evangelists, S. Mark and S. Luke, were an unique,
or even an exceedingly rare phenomenon, it might have been
held to be a somewhat suspicious circumstance that the phenomenon
presented itself in the present section. But nothing
of the sort is the fact. There are no fewer than forty-five
verbs <emph>exclusively used by S. Mark and S. Luke</emph>. And why
should not ἀπιστεῖν be, (as it is,) one of them?
</p>

<p>
(3.) Note, next, that this word <emph>is used twice</emph>, and in the
course of his last chapter too, also <emph>by S. Luke</emph>. Nowhere
else does it occur in the Gospels. It is at least as strange
that the word ἀπιστεῖν should be found twice in the last
chapter of the Gospel according to S. Luke, as in the last
chapter of the Gospel according to S. Mark. And if no
shadow of suspicion is supposed to result from this circumstance
in the case of the third Evangelist, why should it in
the case of the second?
</p>

<p>
(4.) But, lastly, <emph>the noun</emph> ἀπιστία (which occurs in S. Mark
xvi. 14) occurs in two other places of the same Gospel. And
this word (which S. Matthew uses twice,) is employed by
none of the other Evangelists.&mdash;What need to add another
word? Do not many of these supposed suspicious circumstances,&mdash;<emph>this</emph>
one for example,&mdash;prove rather, on closer inspection,
to be confirmatory facts?
</p>

<p>
(IX.) We are next assured that μετὰ ταῦτα (ver. 12) <q><emph>is
not found in Mark</emph>, though many opportunities occurred for
using it.</q>
</p>

<p>
(1.) I suppose that what this learned writer means, is this;
that if S. Mark had coveted an opportunity for introducing
the phrase μετὰ ταῦτα earlier in his Gospel, he might have
found one. (More than this cannot be meant: for <emph>nowhere</emph>
before does S. Mark employ <emph>any other phrase</emph> to express
<q>after these things,</q> or <q>after this,</q> or <q>afterwards.</q>)
</p>

<pb n="160"/><anchor id="Pg160"/>

<p>
But what is the obvious inference from the facts of the case,
as stated by the learned Critic, except that the blessed Evangelist
<emph>must be presumed to have been unconscious of any desire
to introduce the expression under consideration on any other occasion
except the present</emph>?
</p>

<p>
(2.) Then, further, it is worth observing that while the
phrase μετὰ ταῦτα occurs five times in S. Luke's Gospel, it is
found only twice in the Acts; while S. Matthew <emph>never employs
it at all</emph>. Why, then,&mdash;I would respectfully inquire&mdash;<emph>why</emph>
need S. Mark introduce the phrase <emph>more than once</emph>? Why,
especially, is his solitary use of the expression to be represented
as a suspicious circumstance; and even perverted into
an article of indictment against the genuineness of the last
twelve verses of his Gospel? <q>Would any one argue that
S. Luke was not the author of the Acts, because the author
of the Acts has employed this phrase only twice,&mdash;<q>often as
he <emph>could</emph> have used it?</q> (Meyer's phrase here.<note place="foot">Professor
Broadus, <hi rend='italic'>ubi suprà</hi>.</note>)</q>
</p>

<p>
(X.) Another objection awaits us,&mdash;<q>Ἓτερος also is unknown
to Mark,</q> says Dr. Davidson;&mdash;which only means
that the word occurs in chap. xvi. 12, but not elsewhere in
his Gospel.
</p>

<p>
It so happens, however, that ἕτερος also occurs once only
in the Gospel of S. John. Does it therefore throw suspicion
on S. John xix. 37?
</p>

<p>
(XI.) The same thing is said of ὕστερον (in ver. 14) viz.
that it <q>occurs nowhere</q> in the second Gospel.
</p>

<p>
But why not state the case thus?&mdash;Ὕστερον, a word which
is twice employed by S. Luke, occurs only <emph>once</emph> in S. Mark
and <emph>once</emph> in S. John.&mdash;<emph>That</emph> would be the true way of
stating the facts of the case. But it would be attended with this
inconvenient result,&mdash;that it would make it plain that the
word in question has no kind of bearing on the matter in
hand.
</p>

<p>
(XII.) The same thing he says of βλάπτειν (in ver. 18).
</p>

<p>
But what is the fact? The word occurs <emph>only twice in the
Gospels</emph>,&mdash;viz. in S. Mark xvi. 18 and S. Luke iv. 35. It is
one of the eighty-four words which are peculiar to S. Mark
<pb n="161"/><anchor id="Pg161"/>
and S. Luke. What possible significancy would Dr. Davidson
attach to the circumstance?
</p>

<p>
(XIII.) Once more.&mdash;<q>πανταχοῦ</q> (proceeds Dr. Davidson)
<q>is unknown to Mark;</q> which (as we begin to be
aware) is the learned gentleman's way of stating that it is
only found in chap. xvi. 20.
</p>

<p>
Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Alford insist that it <emph>also</emph> occurs
in S. Mark i. 28. I respectfully differ from them in opinion:
but when it has been pointed out that the word <emph>is only used
besides in S. Luke</emph> ix. 6, what <emph>can</emph> be said of such Criticism but
that it is simply frivolous?
</p>

<p>
(XIV. and XV.) Yet again:&mdash;συνεργεῖν and βεβαιοῦν are
also said by the same learned Critic to be <q>unknown to
Mark.</q>
</p>

<p>
S. Mark certainly uses these two words only once,&mdash;viz. in
the last verse of the present Chapter: but what there is suspicious
in this circumstance, I am at a loss even to divine.
He <emph>could</emph> not have used them oftener; and since one hundred
and fifty-six words are peculiar to his Gospel, why should
not συνεργεῖν and βεβαιοῦν be two of them?
</p>

<p>
(XVI.) <q>Πᾶσα κτίσις is Pauline,</q> proceeds Dr. Davidson,
(referring to a famous expression which is found in ver. 15.)
</p>

<p>
(1.) All very oracular,&mdash;to be sure: but <emph>why</emph> πᾶσα κτίσις
should be thought <q>Pauline</q> rather than <q>Petrine,</q> I really,
once more, cannot discover; seeing that S. Peter has the expression
as well as S. Paul.<note place="foot">Col i. 15, 23. 1 S. Pet. ii. 13.</note>
</p>

<p>
(2.) In this place, however, the phrase is πᾶσα ἡ κτίσις.
But even this expression is no more to be called <q>Pauline</q>
than <q>Marcine;</q> seeing that as S. Mark uses it once and
once only, so does S. Paul use it once and once only, viz.
in Rom. viii. 22.
</p>

<p>
(3.) In the meantime, how does it come to pass that the
learned Critic has overlooked the significant fact that the
word κτίσις occurs besides in S. Mark x. 6 and xiii. 19; and
that it is a word which <emph>S. Mark alone of the Evangelists uses</emph>?
Its occurrence, therefore, in this place is a circumstance the
very reverse of suspicious.
</p>

<p>
(4.) But lastly, inasmuch as the opening words of our
<pb n="162"/><anchor id="Pg162"/>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Ministerial Commission to the Apostles are
these,&mdash;κηρύξατε τὸ εὐαγγέλιον πάση τῇ κτίσει (ver. 15):
inasmuch, too, as S. Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians
(i. 23) almost reproduces those very words; speaking of the
Hope τοῦ εὐαγγελίου ... τοῦ κηρυχθέντος ἐν πάση
[τῇ] κτίσει τῇ ὑπὸ τὸν οὐρανόν:&mdash;Is it not an allowable
conjecture that <emph>a direct reference</emph> to <emph>that</emph> place in S. Mark's
Gospel is contained in <emph>this</emph> place of S. Paul's Epistle? that
the inspired Apostle <q>beholding the universal tendency of
Christianity already realized,</q> announces (and from imperial
Rome!) the fulfilment of his <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> commands in his
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
own words as recorded by the Evangelist S. Mark?
</p>

<p>
I desire to be understood to deliver this only as a conjecture.
But seeing that S. Mark's Gospel is commonly thought
to have been written at Rome, and under the eye of S. Peter;
and that S. Peter (and therefore S. Mark) must have been at
Rome before S. Paul visited that city in <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 61;&mdash;seeing,
too, that it was in <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 61-2 (as Wordsworth and Alford are
agreed) that S. Paul wrote his Epistle to the Colossians, and
wrote it from <emph>Rome</emph>;&mdash;I really can discover nothing unreasonable
in the speculation. If, however, it be well founded,&mdash;(and
it is impossible to deny that the coincidence of expression
<emph>may</emph> be such as I have suggested,)&mdash;then, what an
august corroboration would <emph>this</emph> be of <q>the last Twelve
Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark!</q> ... If, indeed,
the great Apostle on reaching Rome inspected S. Mark's
Gospel for the first time, with what awe will he have recognised
in his own recent experience the fulfilment of his
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> great announcement concerning the <q>signs which
should follow them that believe!</q> Had he not himself <q>cast
out devils?</q>&mdash;<q>spoken with tongues more than they all?</q>&mdash;and
at Melita, not only <q>shaken off the serpent into the fire
and felt no harm,</q> but also <q>laid hands on the sick</q> father
of Publius, <q>and he had recovered?</q> ... To return, however,
to matters of fact; with an apology (if it be thought necessary)
for what immediately goes before.
</p>

<p>
(XVII.) Next,&mdash;ἐν τῷ ὀνόματι μου (ver. 17) is noticed as
another suspicious peculiarity. The phrase is supposed to occur
only in this place of S. Mark's Gospel; the Evangelist elsewhere
<pb n="163"/><anchor id="Pg163"/>
employing the preposition ἐπί:&mdash;(viz. in ix. 37: ix. 39:
xiii. 6.)
</p>

<p>
(1.) Now really, if it were so, the reasoning would be nugatory.
<emph>S. Luke</emph> also once, and once only, has ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί
σου: his usage elsewhere being, (like S. Mark's) to use ἐπί.
Nay, in two consecutive verses of ch. ix, ἐπί τῷ ὀνόματί μου&mdash;σου
is read: and yet, in the very next chapter, his Gospel
exhibits an unique instance of the usage of ἐν. Was it
ever thought that suspicion is thereby cast on S. Luke x. 17?
</p>

<p>
(2.) But, in fact, the objection is an oversight of the
learned (and generally accurate) objector. The phrase recurs
in S. Mark ix. 38,&mdash;as the text of that place has been revised
by Tischendorf, by Tregelles and by himself. This is therefore
a slightly <emph>corroborative</emph>, not a suspicious circumstance.
</p>

<p>
(XVIII. and XIX.) We are further assured that παρακολουθεῖν
(in ver. 17) and ἐπακολουθεῖν (in ver. 20) <q>are both
<emph>foreign to the diction of Mark</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
(1.) But what can the learned author of this statement
possibly mean? He is not speaking of the uncompounded
verb ἀκολουθεῖν, of course; for S. Mark employs it at least
twenty times. He cannot be speaking of the compounded
verb; for συνακολουθεῖν occurs in S. Mark v. 37. He cannot
mean that παρακολουθεῖν, because the Evangelist uses
it only once, is suspicious; for that would be to cast a slur
on S. Luke i. 3. He cannot mean generally that verbs compounded
with prepositions are <q>foreign to the diction of
Mark;</q> for there are no less than <emph>forty-two</emph> such verbs
which are even <emph>peculiar to S. Mark's short Gospel</emph>,&mdash;against
thirty which are peculiar to S. Matthew, and seventeen
which are peculiar to S. John. He cannot mean that verbs
compounded with παρά and ἐπί have a suspicious look; for
at least <emph>thirty-three</emph> such compounds, (besides the two before
us,) occur in his sixteen chapters.<note place="foot">παραβάλλειν [I quote from the
Textus Receptus of S. Mark iv. 30,&mdash;confirmed
as it is by the Peshito and the Philoxenian, the Vetus and the Vulgate, the
Gothic and the Armenian versions,&mdash;besides Codd. A and D, and all the other
uncials (except B, L, Δ, א,) and almost every cursive Codex. The evidence of
Cod. C and of Origen is doubtful. <emph>Who</emph> would subscribe to the different
reading adopted on countless similar occasions by the most recent Editors of the
N.T.?]: παραγγέλλειν: παράγειν: παραγίνεσθαι: παραδιδόναι: παραλαμβάνειν:

<pb n="164"/><anchor id="Pg164"/>
really ask, can the learned Critic possibly mean?&mdash;I respectfully
pause for an answer.
</p>

<p>
(2.) In the meantime, I claim that as far as such evidence
goes,&mdash;(and it certainly goes a very little way, yet, <emph>as far as
it goes</emph>,)&mdash;it is a note of S. Mark's authorship, that within the
compass of the last twelve verses of his Gospel these two
compounded verbs should be met with.
</p>

<p>
(XX.) Dr. Davidson points out, as another suspicious circumstance,
that (in ver. 18) the phrase χεῖρας ἐπιτιθέναι
ἐπί τινα occurs; <q>instead of χεῖρας ἐπιτιθέναι τινι.</q>
</p>

<p>
(1.) But on the contrary, the phrase <q><emph>is in Mark's manner</emph>,</q>
says Dean Alford: the plain fact being that it occurs
no less than three times in his Gospel,&mdash;viz. in chap. viii.
25: x. 16: xvi. 18. (The other idiom, he has four times.<note place="foot">S. Mark v.
23: vi. 5: vii. 32: viii. 23.</note>)
Behold, then, one and the same phrase is appealed to as
a note of genuineness <emph>and</emph> as an indication of spurious origin.
What <emph>can</emph> be the value of such Criticism as this?
</p>

<p>
(2.) Indeed, the phrase before us supplies no unapt illustration
of the precariousness of the style of remark which
is just now engaging our attention. Within the space of
three verses, S. Mark has <emph>both</emph> expressions,&mdash;viz. ἐπιθεὶς τὰς
χεῖρας αὐτῷ (viii. 23) and also ἐπέθηκε τὰς χεῖρας ἐπί (ver. 25.) S. Matthew has the
latter phrase once; the former, twice.<note place="foot">S. Matth. ix. 18:&mdash;xix.
13, 15.</note> <emph>Who</emph> will not admit that all this (so-called) Criticism
is the veriest trifling; and that to pretend to argue
about the genuineness of a passage of Scripture from such
evidence as the present is an act of rashness bordering on
folly?... The reader is referred to what was offered above
on Art. VII.
</p>

<p>
(XXI. and XXII.) Again: the words μὲν οὖν&mdash;ὁ Κύριος
(ver. 19 and ver. 20) are also declared to be <q><emph>foreign to the
diction of Mark</emph>.</q> I ask leave to examine these two charges
separately.
</p>

<pb n="165"/><anchor id="Pg165"/>

<p>
(1.) μὲν οὖν occurs only once in S. Mark's Gospel, truly:
but then <emph>it occurs only once in S. Luke</emph> (iii. 18);&mdash;only twice
in S. John (xix. 24: xx. 30):&mdash;in S. Matthew, never at all.
What imaginable plea can be made out of such evidence
as this, for or against the genuineness of the last Twelve
Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?&mdash;Once more, I pause for an
answer.
</p>

<p>
(2.) As for ὁ Κύριος being <q><emph>foreign to the diction of Mark</emph>
in speaking of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>,</q>&mdash;I really do not know what
the learned Critic can possibly mean; except that he finds
our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> <emph>nowhere called</emph> ὁ Κύριος
<emph>by S. Mark, except in this place.</emph>
</p>

<p>
But then, he is respectfully reminded that neither does
he find our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> anywhere called by S. Mark
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus Christ</hi>,</q> except in chap. i. 1. Are we, therefore,
to suspect the beginning of S. Mark's Gospel as well as the end of it?
By no means, (I shall perhaps be told:) a reason is assignable
for the use of <emph>that</emph> expression in chap. i. 1. And so,
I venture to reply, there is a fully sufficient reason assignable
for the use of <emph>this</emph> expression in chap. xvi. 19.<note place="foot">See
below, pp. <ref target="Pg184">184-6</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
(3.) By S. Matthew, by S. Mark, by S. John, our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>
is called Ἰησοῦς Χριστός,&mdash;but <emph>only in the first Chapter</emph> of
their respective Gospels. By S. Luke nowhere. The appellation
may,&mdash;or may not,&mdash;be thought <q>foreign to the
diction</q> of those Evangelists. But surely it constitutes no
reason whatever why we should suspect the genuineness
of the beginning of the first, or the second, or the fourth
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
(4.) S. John <emph>three times in the first verse of his first Chapter</emph>
designates the Eternal <hi rend="smallcaps">Son</hi> by the extraordinary title ὁ
Λόγος; but <emph>nowhere else in his Gospel</emph>, (except once in ver.
14,) does that Name recur. Would it be reasonable to represent
<emph>this</emph> as a suspicious circumstance? Is not the Divine
fitness of that sublime appellation generally recognised and
admitted?<note place="foot">See Pearson <hi rend='italic'>on the Creed</hi>, (ed.
Burton), vol. i. p. 151.</note>&mdash;Surely, we come to Scripture to be learners
only: not to teach the blessed Writers how they ought to
have spoken about <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>! When will men learn that <q>the
<pb n="166"/><anchor id="Pg166"/>
Scripture-phrase, or <emph>language of the Holy
Ghost</emph></q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 183,&mdash;at the
beginning of the exposition of <q><emph>Our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi></emph>.</q></note> is as
much above them as Heaven is above Earth?
</p>

<p>
(XXIII.) Another complaint:&mdash;ἀναληφθῆναι, which is
found in ver. 19, occurs nowhere else in the Gospels.
</p>

<p>
(1.) True. S. Mark has no fewer than seventy-four verbs
which <q>occur nowhere else in the Gospels:</q> and this happens
to be one of them? What possible inconvenience can
be supposed to follow from that circumstance?
</p>

<p>
(2.) But the remark is unreasonable. Ἀναληφθῆναι and
ἀνάληψις are words <emph>proper to the Ascension of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>
into Heaven</emph>. The two Evangelists who do <emph>not</emph> describe that
event, are <emph>without</emph> these words: the two Evangelists who <emph>do</emph>
describe it, <emph>have</emph> them.<note place="foot">S. Mark xvi. 19. S. Luke ix.
51. Acts i. 2.</note> Surely, these are marks of genuineness,
not grounds for suspicion!
</p>

<p>
It is high time to conclude this discussion.&mdash;Much has
been said about two other minute points:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(XXIV.) It is declared that ἐκεῖνος <q>is nowhere found
absolutely used by S. Mark:</q> (the same thing may be said
of S. Matthew and of S. Luke also:) <q>but always emphatically:
whereas in verses 10 and 11, it is absolutely used.</q><note place="foot">Alford.</note>
Another writer says,&mdash;<q>The use of ἐκεῖνος in verses 10, 11,
and 13 (twice) in a manner synonymous with ὁ δέ, is
peculiar.</q><note place="foot">Davidson.</note>
</p>

<p>
(1.) Slightly peculiar it is, no doubt, but not very, that
an Evangelist who employs an ordinary word in the ordinary
way about thirty times in all, should use it <q>absolutely</q>
in two consecutive verses.
</p>

<p>
(2.) But really, until the Critics can agree among themselves
as to <emph>which</emph> are precisely the offending instances,&mdash;(for
it is evidently a moot point whether ἐκεῖνος be emphatic
in ver. 13, or not,)&mdash;we may be excused from a prolonged
discussion of such a question. I shall recur to the
subject in the consideration of the next Article (XXV.)
</p>

<p>
(XXV.) So again, it may be freely admitted that <q>in the
10th and 14th verses there are sentences without a copulative:
<pb n="167"/><anchor id="Pg167"/>
whereas Mark always has the copulative in such cases,
particularly καί.</q> But then,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1.) Unless we can be shewn at least two or three other
sections of S. Mark's Gospel <emph>resembling the present</emph>,&mdash;(I mean,
passages in which S. Mark summarizes many disconnected
incidents, as he does here,)&mdash;is it not plain that such an
objection is wholly without point?
</p>

<p>
(2.) Two instances are cited. In the latter, (ver. 14),
Lachmann and Tregelles read ὔστερον δέ: and the reading
is not impossible. So that the complaint is really reduced
to this,&mdash;That in ver. 10 the Evangelist begins
Ἐκεὶνη πορευθεῖσα, instead of saying Καὶ ἐκείνη πορευθεῖσα.
And (it is implied) there is something so abhorrent
to probability in this, as slightly to strengthen the suspicion
that the entire context is not the work of the Evangelist.
</p>

<p>
(3.) Now, suppose we had S. Mark back among us: and
suppose that he, on being shewn this objection, were to be
heard delivering himself somewhat to the following effect:&mdash;<q>Aye.
But men may not find fault with <emph>that</emph> turn of phrase.
I derived it from Simon Peter's lips. I have always suspected
that it was a kind of echo, so to say, of what he
and <q>the other Disciple</q> had many a time rehearsed in the
hearing of the wondering Church concerning the Magdalene
on the morning of the Resurrection.</q> And then we
should have remembered the familiar place in the fourth
Gospel:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
γύναι τί κλαίεις; τίνα ζητεῖς; ἘΚΕΊΝΗ δοκοῦσα κ.τ.λ.
</p>

<p>
After which, the sentence would not have seemed at all
strange, even though it be <q>without a copulative:</q>&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ἀφ᾽ ἧς ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτὰ δαιμόνια. ἘΚΕΊΝΗ πορευθεῖσα κ.τ.λ.
</p>

<p>
(4.) For after all, the <emph>only</emph> question to be asked is,&mdash;Will
any one pretend that such a circumstance as this is <emph>suspicious</emph>?
Unless <emph>that</emph> be asserted, I see not what is gained by
raking together,&mdash;(<emph>as one easily might do in any section of any
of the Gospels</emph>,)&mdash;every minute peculiarity of form or expression
which can possibly be found within the space of these
twelve verses. It is an evidence of nothing so much as
an incorrigible coarseness of critical fibre, that every slight
variety of manner or language should be thus pounced upon
<pb n="168"/><anchor id="Pg168"/>
and represented as a note of spuriousness,&mdash;in the face of
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) the unfaltering tradition of the Church universal that
the document has <emph>never</emph> been hitherto suspected: and
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) the known proclivity of all writers, as free moral and
intellectual agents, sometimes to deviate from their else
invariable practice.&mdash;May I not here close the discussion?
</p>

<p>
There will perhaps be some to remark, that however successfully
the foregoing objections may seem to have been
severally disposed of, yet that the combined force of such
a multitude of slightly suspicious circumstances must be not
only appreciable, but even remain an inconvenient, not to
say a formidable fact. Let me point out that the supposed
remark is nothing else but a fallacy; which is detected the
instant it is steadily looked at.
</p>

<p>
For if there really had remained after the discussion of
each of the foregoing XXV Articles, a slight residuum of
suspiciousness, <emph>then</emph> of course the aggregate of so many fractions
would have amounted to something in the end.
</p>

<p>
But since it has been proved that there is absolutely
<emph>nothing at all</emph> suspicious in <emph>any</emph> of the alleged circumstances
which have been hitherto examined, the case becomes altogether
different. The sum of ten thousand nothings is still
nothing.<note place="foot">Exactly so Professor Broadus:&mdash;<q>Now it will not do
to say that while no one of these peculiarities would itself prove the style to be
foreign to Mark, the whole of them combined will do so. It is very true that the
multiplication of <emph>littles</emph> may amount to much; but not so the
multiplication of <emph>nothings</emph>.
And how many of the expressions which are cited, appear, in the light of our
examination, to retain the slightest real force as proving difference of authorship?
Is it not true that most of them, and those the most important, are
reduced to absolutely nothing, while the remainder possess scarcely any appreciable
significance?</q>&mdash;p. 360, (see above, p. <ref target="Pg139">139</ref>, note
g.)</note> This may be conveniently illustrated by an appeal
to the only charge which remains to be examined.
</p>

<p>
(XXVI. and XXVII.) The absence from these twelve
verses of the adverbs εὐθέως and πάλιν,&mdash;(both of them
favourite words with the second Evangelist,)&mdash;has been
pointed out as one more suspicious circumstance. Let us
take the words singly:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) The adverb εὐθέως (or εὐθύς) is indeed of <emph>very</emph>
frequent occurrence in S. Mark's Gospel. And yet its absence from
<pb n="169"/><anchor id="Pg169"/>
chap. xvi is <emph>proved</emph> to be in no degree a suspicious circumstance,
from the discovery that though it occurs as many as
</p>

<p>
12 times in chap. i;<lb/>
and 6 times in chap. v;<lb/>
and 5 times in chap. iv, vi;<lb/>
and 3 times in chap. ii, ix, xiv;<lb/>
and 2 times in chap. vii, xi;<lb/>
it yet occurs only 1 times in chap. iii, viii, x, xv;<lb/>
while it occurs 0 times in chap. xii, xiii, xvi.
</p>

<p>
(b) In like manner, πάλιν, which occurs as often as
</p>

<p>
6 times in chap. xiv;<lb/>
and 5 times in chap. x;<lb/>
and 3 times in chap. viii, xv;<lb/>
and 2 times in chap. ii, iii, vii, xi, xii;<lb/>
and 1 times in chap. iv, v;<lb/>
occurs 0 times in chap. i, vi, ix, xiii. xvi.<note place="foot">S. John has πάλιν
(47 times) much oftener than S. Mark (29 times). And
yet, πάλιν is not met with in the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>, or the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi>, or the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, or the
vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, or
the xv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, or the
xvii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter of S. John's Gospel.</note>
</p>

<p>
(1.) Now,&mdash;How can it possibly be more suspicious that
πάλιν should be absent from <emph>the last twelve</emph> verses of S. Mark,
than that it should be away from <emph>the first forty-five</emph>?
</p>

<p>
(2.) Again. Since εὐθέως is not found in the xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
or the xiii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapters of this same
Gospel,&mdash;nor πάλιν in the i<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi>,
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, or
xiii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter,&mdash;(for the sufficient reason
that <emph>neither word is wanted in any of those places</emph>,)&mdash;what
possible <q>suspiciousness</q> can be supposed to result from the absence of
both words from the xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter also, where
<emph>also</emph> neither of them is wanted? <emph>Why</emph> is the
xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter of S. Mark's
Gospel,&mdash;or rather, why are <q>the last twelve verses</q> of it,&mdash;to
labour under such special disfavor and discredit?
</p>

<p>
(3.) Dr. Tregelles makes answer,&mdash;<q>I am well aware that
arguments on <emph>style</emph> are often very fallacious, and that <emph>by
themselves</emph> they prove very little: but when there does exist external
evidence, and when internal proofs as to style, manner,
verbal expression, and connection, are in accordance with
such independent grounds of forming a judgment; then these
internal considerations possess very great
weight.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p.
256.</note>&mdash;For all
<pb n="170"/><anchor id="Pg170"/>
rejoinder, the respected writer is asked,&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) But when
there <emph>does not</emph> exist any such external evidence: what then?
Next, he is reminded (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) That whether there does, or does
not, it is at least certain that <emph>not one</emph> of those <q>proofs as to
style,</q> &amp;c., of which he speaks, has been able to stand
the test of strict examination. Not only is the precariousness
of all such Criticism as has been brought to bear against
the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 excessive, but the
supposed facts adduced in evidence have been found out to
be every one of them <emph>mistakes</emph>;&mdash;being either, (1) demonstrably
without argumentative cogency of any kind;&mdash;or
else, (2) distinctly corroborative and confirmatory circumstances:
indications that this part of the Gospel is indeed by
S. Mark,&mdash;<emph>not</emph> that it is probably the work of another hand.
</p>

<p>
And thus the formidable enumeration of twenty-seven
grounds of suspicion vanishes out of sight: fourteen of them
proving to be frivolous and nugatory; and <emph>thirteen</emph>, more or
less clearly witnessing <emph>in favour</emph> of the section.<note place="foot">It
will be found that of the former class (1) are the following:&mdash;Article iii:
vii: ix: x: xi: xii: xiii: xiv: xv: xxi: xxiv: xxv: xxvi: xxvii. Of the
latter (2):&mdash;Art. i: ii: iv: v: vi: viii: xvi: xvii: xviii: xix: xx: xxii:
xxiii.</note>
</p>

<p>
III. Of these thirteen expressions, some are even eloquent
in their witness. I am saying that it is impossible not to be
exceedingly struck by the discovery that this portion of the
Gospel contains (as I have explained already) so many indications
of S. Mark's undoubted manner. Such is the reference
to ἡ κτίσις (in ver. 15):&mdash;the mention of ἀπιστία (in
ver. 14):&mdash;the occurrence of the verb πορεύεσθαι (in ver. 10
and 12),&mdash;of the phrase ἐν τῷ ὀνόματί μου (in ver. 17),&mdash;and
of the phrase χεῖρας ἐτιτιθέναι ἐπί τινα (in ver. 18):&mdash;of the
Evangelical term for our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Ascension, viz. ἀνελήφθη
(in ver. 19):&mdash;and lastly, of the compounds παρακολουθεῖν
and ἐπακολουθεῖν (in verses 17 and 20.)
</p>

<p>
To these Thirteen, will have to be added all those other
notes of identity of authorship,&mdash;such as they are,&mdash;which
result from recurring identity of phrase, and of which the
assailants of this portion of the Gospel have prudently said
nothing. Such are the following:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(xiv.) Ἀνίσταναι, for rising <emph>from the dead</emph>; which is one
<pb n="171"/><anchor id="Pg171"/>
of S. Mark's words. Taking into account the shortness of
his Gospel, he has it thrice as often as S. Luke; <emph>twelve times</emph>
as often as S. Matthew or S. John.
</p>

<p>
(xv.) The idiomatic expression πορευομένοις εἰς ἀγρόν,
of which S. Matthew does not present a single specimen;
but which occurs three times in the short Gospel of S. Mark,<note place="foot">Ch.
xiii. 16,&mdash;ὁ εἰς τὸν ἀγρὸν ὤν: and ch. xv. 21,&mdash;ἐρχόμενον ἀπ᾽ ἀγροῦ,&mdash;an
expression which S. Luke religiously reproduces in the corresponding place
of his Gospel, viz. in ch. xxiii. 26.</note>&mdash;of
which ver. 12 is one.
</p>

<p>
(xvi.) The expression προί (in ver. 9,)&mdash;of which S. Mark
avails himself six times: i.e. (if the length of the present
Gospel be taken into account) almost five times as often as
either S. Matthew or S. John,&mdash;S. Luke never using the word
at all. In his first chapter (ver. 35), and here in his last
(ver. 2), S. Mark uses λίαν in connexion with προί.
</p>

<p>
(xvii.) The phrase κηρύσσειν τὸ εὐαγγέλιον (in ver. 15) is
another of S. Mark's phrases. Like S. Matthew, he employs
it four times (i. 14: xiii. 10: xiv. 9: xvi. 15): but it occurs
neither in S. Luke's nor in S. John's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
(xviii.) The same <emph>words</emph> singly are characteristic of his
Gospel. Taking the length of their several narratives into
account, S. Mark has the word κηρύσσειν more than twice as
often as S. Matthew: three times as often as S. Luke.
</p>

<p>
(xix.) εὐαγγέλιον,&mdash;a word which occurs only in the first
two Gospels,&mdash;is found twice as often in S. Mark's as in
S. Matthew's Gospel: and if the respective length of their
Gospels be considered, the proportion will be as three to one.
It occurs, as above stated, in ver. 15.
</p>

<p>
(xx.) If such Critics as Dr. Davidson had been concerned
to vindicate <emph>the genuineness</emph> of this section of the Gospel, we
should have been assured that φανερουσθαι is another of
S. Mark's words: by which they would have meant no more
than this,&mdash;that though employed neither by S. Matthew
nor by S. Luke it is used thrice by S. Mark,&mdash;being found
twice in this section (verses 12, 14), as well as in ch. iv. 22.
</p>

<p>
(xxi.) They would have also pointed out that σκληροκαρδία
is another of S. Mark's words: being employed neither by
S. Luke nor by S. John,&mdash;by S. Matthew only once,&mdash;but
by S. Mark on <emph>two</emph> occasions; of which ch. xvi. 14 is one.
</p>

<pb n="172"/><anchor id="Pg172"/>

<p>
(xxii.) In the same spirit, they would have bade us observe
that πανταχοῦ (ver. 20)&mdash;unknown to S. Matthew and
S. John, and employed only once by S. Luke,&mdash;is <emph>twice</emph> used
by S. Mark; one instance occurring in the present section.
</p>

<p>
Nor would it have been altogether unfair if they had
added that the precisely similar word πανταχόθεν (or πάντοθεν)
is only found in this same Gospel,&mdash;viz. in ch. i. 45.
</p>

<p>
(xxiii.) They would further have insisted (and this time
with a greater show of reason) that the adverb καλῶς (which
is found in ver. 18) is another favorite word with S. Mark:
occurring as it does, (when the length of these several narratives
is taken into account,) more than twice as often in
S. Mark's as in S. John's Gospel,&mdash;just three times as often
as in the Gospel of S. Matthew and S. Luke.
</p>

<p>
(xxiv.) A more interesting (because a more just) observation
would have been that ἔχειν, in the sense of <q>to be,</q> (as
in the phrase καλῶς ἔχειν, ver. 18,) is characteristic of
S. Mark. He has it oftener than any of the Evangelists,
viz. six times in all (ch. i. 32, 34: ii. 17: v. 23: vi. 55:
xvi. 18.) Taking the shortness of his Gospel into account,
he employs this idiom twice as often as S. Matthew;&mdash;three
times as often as S. John;&mdash;four times as often as S. Luke.
</p>

<p>
(xxv.) They would have told us further that ἄῤῥωστος is
another of S. Mark's favorite words: for that he has it <emph>three</emph>
times,&mdash;viz. in ch. vi. 5, 13, and here in ver. 18. S. Matthew
has it only once. S. Luke and S. John not at all.
</p>

<p>
(xxvi.) And we should have been certainly reminded by
them that the conjunction of πενθοῦσι καὶ κλαίουσι (in
ver. 10) is characteristic of S. Mark,&mdash;who has κλαίοντας καὶ
ἀλαλάζοντας in ch. v. 38: θορυβεῖσθε και κλαίετε in the
very next verse. As for πενθεῖν, it is one of the 123 words
common to S. Matthew and S. Mark, and peculiar to their
two Gospels.
</p>

<p>
(xxvii.) Lastly, <q>κατακρίνω (in ver. 16), instead of κρίνω,
is Mark's word, (comp. x. 33: xiv. 64).</q> The simple verb
which is used four times by S. Matthew, five times by
S. Luke, nineteen times by S. John, is never at all employed
by S. Mark: whereas the compound verb he has oftener in
proportion than S. Matthew,&mdash;more than twice as often as
either S. Luke or S. John.
</p>

<pb n="173"/><anchor id="Pg173"/>

<p>
Strange,&mdash;that there should be exactly <q>xxvii</q> notes of
genuineness discoverable in these twelve verses, instead of
<q>XXVII</q> grounds of suspicion!
</p>

<p>
But enough of all this. Here, we may with advantage
review the progress hitherto made in this inquiry.
</p>

<p>
I claim to have demonstrated long since that all those imposing
assertions respecting the <q>Style</q> and <q>Phraseology</q>
of this section of the Gospel which were rehearsed at the
outset,<note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg146">146</ref>.</note>&mdash;are
destitute of foundation. But from this discovery
alone there results a settled conviction which it will
be found difficult henceforth to disturb. A page of Scripture
which has been able to endure so severe an ordeal of
hostile inquiry, has been <emph>proved</emph> to be above suspicion. <emph>That</emph>
character is rightly accounted <emph>blameless</emph> which comes out
unsullied after Calumny has done her worst; done it systematically;
done it with a will; done it for a hundred years.
</p>

<p>
But this is not an adequate statement of the facts of the
case in respect of the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel. Something
<emph>more</emph> is certain than that the charges which have been
so industriously brought against this portion of the Gospel are
without foundation. It has been also proved that instead of
there being discovered twenty-seven suspicious words and
phrases scattered up and down these twelve verses of the
Gospel, there actually exist exactly as many words and
phrases which attest with more or less certainty that those
verses are nothing else but the work of the Evangelist.
</p>

<p>
IV. And now it is high time to explain that though
I have hitherto condescended to adopt the method of my
opponents, I have only done so in order to shew that it
proves fatal to <emph>themselves</emph>. I am, to say the truth, ashamed of
what has last been written,&mdash;so untrustworthy do I deem the
method which, (following the example of those who have
preceded me in this inquiry,) I have hitherto pursued. The
<q>Concordance test,</q>&mdash;(for <emph>that</emph> is probably as apt and intelligible
a designation as can be devised for the purely <emph>mechanical</emph>
process whereby it is proposed by a certain school of
Critics to judge of the authorship of Scripture,)&mdash;is about
the coarsest as well as about the most delusive that could be
<pb n="174"/><anchor id="Pg174"/>
devised. By means of this clumsy and vulgar instrument,
especially when applied, (as in the case before us,) without
skill and discrimination, it would be just as easy to prove
that <emph>the first</emph> twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel are of a suspicious
character as <emph>the last</emph>.<note place="foot"><p>The reader will be perhaps
interested with the following passage in the
pages of Professor Broadus already (p. 139 note g) alluded to:&mdash;<q rend="pre">It
occurred to me to examine the twelve just preceding verses, (xv. 44 to xvi. 8,) and by
a curious coincidence, the words and expressions not elsewhere employed by
Mark, footed up precisely the same number, seventeen. Those noticed are the
following (text of Tregelles):&mdash;ver. 44, τέθηκεν (elsewhere ἀποθνήσκο):&mdash;ver.
45, γνοὺς ἀπό, a construction found nowhere else in the New Testament:
also ἐδωρήσατο and πτῶμα: ver. 46, ἐνείλησεν, λελατομημένον, πέτρας,
προσεκύλισεν:&mdash;chap. xvi. ver. 1, διαγενομένου, and ἀρώματα: ver. 2, μιᾷ τῶν
σαββάτων:&mdash;ver. 3, ἀποκυλίσει:&mdash;ver. 4, ἀνεκεκύλισται. Also, σφόδρα, (Mark's
word is λίαν.) Ver. 5, ἀν τοῖς δεξιοῖς is a construction not found in Mark, or
the other Gospels, though the word δεξιός occurs frequently:&mdash;ver. 8, εἶχεν, in
this particular sense, not elsewhere in the New Testament: τρόμος.</q>
</p>
<p>
<q>This list is perhaps not complete, for it was prepared in a few hours&mdash;about
as much time, it may be said, without disrespect, as Fritsche and Meyer
appear to have given to their collections of examples from the other passage.
It is not proposed to discuss the list, though some of the instances are curious.
It is not claimed that they are all important, but that they are all real. And
as regards the single question of the <emph>number</emph> of peculiarities, they
certainly form quite an offset to the number upon which Dean Alford has laid
stress.</q>&mdash;p. 361.</p></note> In truth, except in very
skilful hands, it is no test at all, and can only mislead.
</p>

<p>
Thus, (in ver. 1,) we should be informed (i.) that <q>Mark
nowhere uses the appellation <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus Christ</hi>:</q> and (ii.) that
<q>εὐαγγέλιον Ἰησοῦ Χριστοῦ</q> is <q><emph>Pauline</emph></q>&mdash;We should be
reminded (iii.) that this Evangelist nowhere introduces any
of the Prophets by name, and that therefore the mention of
<q>Isaiah</q><note place="foot">Tischendorf, Tregelles, Alford.</note> (in ver. 2) is a
suspicious circumstance:&mdash;(iv.) that
a quotation from the Old Testament is <q>foreign to his manner,</q>&mdash;(for
writers of this class would not hesitate to assume
that S. Mark xv. 28 is no part of the Gospel;)&mdash;and (v.) that
the fact that here are quotations from <emph>two</emph> different prophets,
betrays an unskilful hand.&mdash;(vi.) Because S. Mark three times
calls Judæa by its usual name (Ιουδαια, viz. in iii. 7: x. 1:
xiii. 14), the <emph>unique</emph> designation, ἡ Ἰουδαία χώρα (in ver. 5)
would be pronounced decisive against <q>the authorship of
Mark.</q>&mdash;(vii.) The same thing would be said of the <emph>unique</emph>
<pb n="175"/><anchor id="Pg175"/>
expression, ἐν Ἰορδάνη ποταμῷ, which is found in ver. 5,&mdash;seeing
that this Evangelist three times designates Jordan
simply as Ἰορδάνης (i. 9: iii. 8: x. 1).&mdash;(viii.) <emph>That</emph> entire
expression in ver. 7 (<emph>unique</emph>, it must be confessed, in the Gospel,)
οὖ οὐκ εἰμὶ ἱκανος&mdash;ὑποδημάτων αὐτοῦ, would be pronounced
<q>abhorrent to the style of Mark.</q>&mdash;(ix.) τὸ Πνεῦμα
<emph>twice</emph>, (viz. in ver. 10 and ver. 12) we should be told is never
used by the Evangelist absolutely for the <hi rend="smallcaps">Holy Ghost</hi>: but
always τὸ Πνεῦμα τὸ Ἅγιον (as in ch. iii. 29: xii. 36:
xiii. 11).&mdash;(x.) The same would be said of οἱ Ἱεροσολυμῖται
(in ver. 5) for <q>the inhabitants of Jerusalem:</q> we should
be assured that S. Mark's phrase would rather be οἱ ἀπὸ
Ἱεροσολύμων,&mdash;as in ch. iii. 8 and 22.&mdash;And (xi.) the expression
πιστεύειν ἐν τῷ εὐαγγελίῷ (ver. 15), we should be
informed <q>cannot be Mark's;</q>&mdash;who either employs εἰς and
the accusative (as in ch. ix. 92), or else makes the verb take
a dative (as in ch. xi. 31: xvi. 13, 14.)&mdash;We should also probably
be told that the ten following words are all <q>unknown
to Mark:</q>&mdash;(xii.) τρίχες,&mdash;(xiii.) δερματίνη,&mdash;(xiv.)
ὀσφύς,&mdash;(xv.) ἀκρίδες,&mdash;(xvi.) μέλι,&mdash;(xvii.) ἄγριος,(six instances in
a single verse (ver. 6): a highly suspicious circumstance!),&mdash;(xviii.)
κύπτειν,&mdash;(xix.) ἱμάς,&mdash;(xx.) ὑποδήματα, (all three
instances in ver. 7!)&mdash;(xxi.) εὐδοκεῖν,&mdash;(xxii.) καὶ ἐγένετο ...
ἦλθεν (ver. 9),&mdash;unique in S. Mark!&mdash;(xxiii.) βαπτίζεσθαι
εἰς (ver 9), another unique phrase!&mdash;(xxiv.) οἱ οὐρανοί <emph>twice</emph>,
(viz. in verses 10, 11) yet elsewhere, when <emph>S. Mark</emph> speaks
of Heaven, (ch. vi. 41: vii. 34: viii. 11: xvi. 19) he always
uses the singular.&mdash;Lastly, (xxv.) the same sorry objection
which was brought against the <q>last twelve verses,</q> (that
πάλιν, a favourite adverb with S. Mark, is not found there,)
is here even more conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
Turning away from all this,&mdash;(not, however, without an
apology for having lingered over such frivolous details so
long,)&mdash;I desire to point out that we have reverently to look
below the surface, if we would ascertain how far it is to be
presumed from internal considerations whether S. Mark was
indeed the author of this portion of his Gospel, or not.
</p>

<p>
V. We must devise, I say, some more delicate, more philosophical,
more <emph>real</emph> test than the coarse, uncritical expedient
<pb n="176"/><anchor id="Pg176"/>
which has been hitherto considered of ascertaining by reference
to the pages of a Greek Concordance whether a certain
word which is found in this section of the Gospel is, or is
not, used elsewhere by S. Mark. And I suppose it will be
generally allowed to be deserving of attention,&mdash;in fact, to
be a singularly corroborative circumstance,&mdash;that within the
narrow compass of these Twelve Verses we meet with <emph>every
principal characteristic of S. Mark's manner</emph>:&mdash;Thus,
</p>

<p>
(i.) Though he is the Author of the shortest of the Gospels,
and though to all appearance he often merely reproduces
what S. Matthew has said before him, or else anticipates
something, which is afterwards delivered by S. Luke,&mdash;it
is surprising how often we are indebted to S. Mark for
precious pieces of information which we look for in vain
elsewhere. Now, this is a feature of the Evangelist's manner
which is susceptible of memorable illustration from the
section before us.
</p>

<p>
How many and how considerable are the <emph>new circumstances</emph>
which S. Mark here delivers!&mdash;(1) That Mary Magdalene
was <emph>the first</emph> to behold the risen <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi>: (2)
That it was <emph>He</emph> who had cast out from her the <q>seven devils:</q> (3)
<emph>How the men were engaged</emph> to whom she brought her joyful message,&mdash;(4)
who not only did not believe <emph>her</emph> story, but when
Cleopas and his companion declared what had happened to
themselves, <q><emph>neither believed they them</emph>.</q> (5) The terms of
the Ministerial Commission, as set down in verses 15 and 16,
are unique. (6) The announcement of the <q>signs which
should follow them that believe</q> is even extraordinary.
Lastly, (7) this is the only place in the Gospel where <emph>The
Session at the right Hand of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi></emph> is recorded.... So
many, and such precious incidents, showered into the Gospel Treasury
at the last moment, and with such a lavish hand, must
needs have proceeded if not from an Apostle at least from
a companion of Apostles. O, if we had no other token to
go by, there could not be a reasonable doubt that this entire
section is by no other than S. Mark himself!
</p>

<p>
(ii.) A second striking characteristic of the second Evangelist
is his love of picturesque, or at least of striking details,&mdash;his
proneness to introduce exceedingly minute particulars,
<pb n="177"/><anchor id="Pg177"/>
often of the profoundest significancy, and always of considerable
interest. Not to look beyond the Twelve Verses
(chap. i. 9-20) which were originally proposed for comparison,&mdash;We
are reminded (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) that in describing our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Baptism, it is only S. Mark who relates that <q>He
came <emph>from Nazareth</emph></q> to be baptized.&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>)
In his highly elliptical account of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Temptation,
it is only he who relates that <q>He was <emph>with the wild
beasts</emph>.</q>&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) In his
description of the Call of the four Disciples, S. Mark alone
it is who, (notwithstanding the close resemblance of his
account to what is found in S. Matthew,) records that the
father of S. James and S. John was left <q>in the ship <emph>with
the hired servants</emph>.</q><note place="foot">S. Mark i. 9: 14: 20.</note>&mdash;Now,
of this characteristic, we have
also within these twelve verses, at least four illustrations:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Note in ver. 10, that life-like touch which evidently
proceeded from an eye-witness,&mdash;<q>πενθοῦσι καὶ κλαίουσι.</q>
S. Mark relates that when Mary conveyed to the Disciples
the joyous tidings of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Resurrection,
<emph>she found them overwhelmed with sorrow</emph>,&mdash;<q>mourning and weeping.</q>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Note also that the unbelief recorded in ver. 13 is
<emph>recorded only there.</emph>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) Again. S. Mark not only says that as the two Disciples
were <q>going into the country,</q> (πορευόμενοι εἰς ἀγρόν,<note place="foot">The same
word is found also in S. Luke's narrative of the same event, ch. xxiv. 13.</note>
ver. 12,) <hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi> also <q>went with
them</q>&mdash;(συν-επορεύετο, as
S. Luke relates;)&mdash;but that it was <emph>as they actually <q>walked</q>
along</emph> (περιπατοῦσιν) that this manifestation took place.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>d</hi>) Among the marvellous predictions made concerning
<q>them that believe;</q> what can be imagined more striking
than the promise that they should <q><emph>take up serpents</emph>;</q> and
suffer no harm even if they should <q><emph>drink any deadly thing</emph></q>?
</p>

<p>
(iii) Next,&mdash;all have been struck, I suppose, with S. Mark's
proneness to substitute some expression of his own for what
he found in the Gospel of his predecessor S. Matthew: or,
when he anticipates something which is afterwards met with
in the Gospel of S. Luke, his aptness to deliver it in language
entirely independent of the later Evangelist. I allude,
for instance; to his substitution of ἐπιβαλὼν ἔκλαιε (xiv. 72)
<pb n="178"/><anchor id="Pg178"/>
for S. Matthew's ἔκλαυσε μικρῶς (xxvi. 75);&mdash;and of ὁ τέκτων
(vi. 3) for ὁ τοῧ τέκτονος υιος (S. Matth. xiii. 55).&mdash;The
<q>woman of Canaan</q> in S. Matthew's Gospel (γυνὴ Χαναναία,
ch. xv. 22), is called <q>a Greek, a Syrophenician by
nation</q> in S. Mark's (Ἑλληνὶς, Συροφοίνισσα τῷ γένει,
ch. vii. 26).&mdash;At the Baptism, instead of the <q><emph>opened</emph></q>
heavens of S. Matthew (ἀνεῷχθησαν, ch. iii. 16) and S. Luke
(ἀνεῳχθῆναι, ch. iii. 22), we are presented by S. Mark with
the striking image of the heavens <q><emph>cleaving</emph></q> or <q><emph>being rent
asunder</emph></q> (σχιζομένους,<note place="foot">On which, Victor of Antioch (if indeed
it be he) finely remarks,&mdash;Σχίζονται δὲ οἱ οὐρονοὶ, ἢ κατὰ Ματθαον ἀνοίγονται, ἵνα
τοῖς ἀνθρώποις ἀποδοθῇ ἐξ οὐρανοῦ ὁ ἁγιασμὸς, καὶ συναφθῇ τος ἐπιγείοις
τὰ οὐράνια.&mdash;(Cramer i. p. 271.)</note> ch. i. 10).&mdash;What S. Matthew calls
τὰ ὅρια Μαγδαλά (ch. xv. 39), S. Mark designates as τὰ
μέρθ Δαλμανουθά (ch. viii. 10.)&mdash;In place of S. Matthew's
ζύμη Σαδδουκαίων (ch. xvi. 6), S. Mark has ζύμη Ἡρώδου
(ch. viii. 15.)&mdash;In describing the visit to Jericho, for the δύο
τυφλοί of S. Matthew (ch. xx. 29), S. Mark gives υἱὸς Τιμαίου
Βαρτίμαιος ὁ τυφλὸς ... προσαιτῶν (ch. ch. 46.)&mdash;For the
κλάδους of S. Matth. xxi. 8, S. Mark (ch. xi. 8) has στοιβάδας;
and for the other's πρὶν ἀλέκτορα φωνῆσαι (xxvi.
34), he has πρὶν ἢ δίς (xiv. 30.)&mdash;It is so throughout.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly,&mdash;(as we have already more than once had occasion
to remark,)&mdash;whereas the rest say only ἡ μία τῶν σαββάτων,
S. Mark says πρώτη σαββάτου (in ver. 9).&mdash;Whereas
S. Luke (viii. 2) says ἀφ᾽ ἧς δαιμόνια ἑπτὰ ἐξεληλύθει,&mdash;S.
Mark records that from her ἐκβεβλήκει ἑπτὰ δαιμόνια.&mdash;Very
different is the great ministerial Commission as set
down by S. Mark in ver. 15, 16, from what is found in
S. Matthew xxviii. 19, 20.&mdash;And whereas S. Luke says <q><emph>their
eyes were holden</emph> that they should not know Him,</q> S. Mark
says that <q>He appeared to them <emph>in another form</emph>.</q> ... Is it
credible that any one fabricating a conclusion to S. Mark's
narrative after S. Luke's Gospel had appeared, would have
ventured so to paraphrase S. Luke's statement? And yet,
let the consistent truthfulness of either expression be carefully
noted. <emph>Both</emph> are historically accurate, but they proceed
from opposite points of view. Viewed on the heavenly
side, (God's side), the Disciples' <q>eyes</q> (of course) <q><emph>were
<pb n="179"/><anchor id="Pg179"/>
holden</emph>:</q>&mdash;viewed on the earthly side, (Man's side), the risen
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> (no doubt) <q><emph>appeared in another
form</emph>.</q>
</p>

<p>
(iv.) Then further, S. Mark is observed to introduce many
expressions into his Gospel which confirm the prevalent
tradition that it was <emph>at Rome</emph> he wrote it; and that it was
with an immediate view to <emph>Latin</emph> readers that it was published.
Twelve such expressions were enumerated above
(at p. <ref target="Pg150">150-1</ref>); and such, it was also there shewn, most
unmistakably is the phrase πρώτη σαββάτου in ver. 9.&mdash;It is
simply incredible that any one but an Evangelist writing
under the peculiar conditions traditionally assigned to S.
Mark, would have hit upon such an expression as this,&mdash;the
strict equivalent, to Latin ears, for ἡ μία σαββάτων,
which has occurred just above, in ver. 2. Now this, it will
be remembered, is one of the hacknied objections to the genuineness
of this entire portion of the Gospel;&mdash;quite proof
enough, if proof were needed, of the exceeding <emph>improbability</emph>
which attaches to the phrase, in the judgment of those who
have considered this question the most.
</p>

<p>
(v.) The last peculiarity of S. Mark to which I propose
to invite attention is supplied by those expressions which
connect his Gospel with S. Peter, and remind us of the constant
traditional belief of the ancient Church that S. Mark
was the companion of the chief of the Apostles.
</p>

<p>
That the second Gospel contains many such hints has
often been pointed out; never more interestingly or more
convincingly than by Townson<note place="foot">Disc. v. Sect. ii.</note> in a work
which deserves to be in the hands of every student of Sacred Science. Instead
of reproducing any of the familiar cases in order to
illustrate my meaning, I will mention one which has perhaps
never been mentioned in this connexion before.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Reference is made to our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
sayings in S. Mark vii, and specially to what is found in ver. 19. <emph>That</emph>
expression, <q>purging all meats</q> (καθαρίζων<note place="foot">This appears to be
the true reading.</note> πάντα τὰ βρώματα), does
really seem to be no part of the Divine discourse; but the
Evangelist's inspired comment on the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi>
words.<note place="foot">So Chrysostom:&mdash;ὁ δὲ Μάρκος φησὶν, ὅτι <q>καθαρίζων τὰ
βρώματα,</q> ταῦτα ἔλεγεν. [vii. 526 a].&mdash;He seems to have derived that remark from
Origen [<hi rend='italic'>in Matth.</hi> ed. Huet. i. 249
<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>]:&mdash;κατὰ τὸν Μάρκον ἔλεγε ταῦτα ὁ Σωτὴρ <q>καθαρίζων
πάντα τὰ βρώματα.</q>&mdash;From the same source, I suspect, Gregory Thaumaturgus
(Origen's disciple), Bp. of Neocæsarea in Pontus, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 261,
[<hi rend='italic'>Routh</hi>, iii. 257] derived the following:&mdash;καὶ ὁ Σωτὴρ ὁ
<q>πάντα καθαρίζων τὰ βρώματα</q> οὐ τὸ εἰσπορευόμενον, φησὶ, κοινοῖ τὸν ἄνθρωπον, ἀλλὰ
τὸ ἐκπορευόμενον.&mdash;See, by all means, Field's most interesting
<hi rend='italic'>Adnotationes in Chrys.</hi>, vol. iii. p. 112.... Εντευθεν (finely
says Victor of Antioch) ὁ καινὸς ἄρχεται νόμος ὁ κατὰ τὸ πνεῦμα.
(<hi rend='italic'>Cramer</hi> i. 335.)</note>
</p>

<pb n="180"/><anchor id="Pg180"/>

<p>
Our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> (he explains) by that discourse of His&mdash;ipso,
facto&mdash;<q><emph>made all meats clean</emph>.</q> How doubly striking a statement,
when it is remembered that probably Simon Peter
himself was the actual author of it;&mdash;the same who, on the
house-top at Joppa, had been shewn in a vision that <q><hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>
<emph>had made clean</emph></q> (ὁ Θεὸς ἐκαθάρισε<note place="foot">Acts x. 15.</note>)
<emph>all</emph> His creatures!
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Now, let a few words spoken by the same S. Peter on
a memorable occasion be considered:&mdash;<q>Wherefore of these
men which have companied with us all the time that the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord Jesus</hi> went in and out among us, <emph>beginning from the
Baptism of John</emph>, unto that same day that <emph>He was taken up</emph>
(ἀνελήφθη) from us, must one be ordained to be a witness
with us of His Resurrection.</q><note place="foot">Acts i. 22, 23. Cf. ver.
2,&mdash;ἄχρι ἧς ἡμέρας ... ἀνελήφθη.</note> Does not S. Peter thereby
define the precise limits of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi>
Ministry,&mdash;shewing it to have <q>begun</q> (ἀρξάμενος) <q>from the Baptism of
John,</q>&mdash;and closed with the Day of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
Ascension? And what else are those but the exact bounds of S. Mark's
Gospel,&mdash;of which the ἀρχή (ch. i. 1) is signally declared
to have been <emph>the Baptism of John</emph>,&mdash;and the utmost limit,
the day when (as S. Mark says) <q><emph>He was taken up</emph> (ἀνελήφθη)
into Heaven,</q>&mdash;(ch. xvi. 19)?
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) I will only further remind the reader, in connexion
with the phrase, πᾶσῃ τῇ κτίσει, in ver. 15,&mdash;(concerning
which, the reader is referred back to page <ref target="Pg162">162-3</ref>,)&mdash;that
both S. Peter and S. Mark (but no other of the sacred writers)
conspire to use the expression ἀπ᾽ ἀρχῆς κτίσεως.<note place="foot">S. Mark x. 6:
xiii. 19.&mdash;2 S. Pet. iii. 4 (Cf. 1 S. Pet. ii. 13.)</note> S. Mark
has besides κτίσεως ἧς ἔκτισε ὁ Θεός (ch. xiii. 19); while
S. Peter alone styles the <hi rend="smallcaps">Almighty</hi>, from His work of Creation,
ὁ κτίστης (1 S. Pet. iv. 19).
</p>

<p>
VI. But besides, and over and above such considerations
<pb n="181"/><anchor id="Pg181"/>
as those which precede,&mdash;(some of which, I am aware, might
be considerably evacuated of their cogency; while others,
I am just as firmly convinced, will remain forcible witnesses
of <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Truth to the end of Time,)&mdash;I hesitate not to
avow my personal conviction that abundant and striking evidence
is garnered up within the brief compass of these Twelve
Verses that they are identical in respect of fabric with the
rest of the Gospel; were clearly manufactured out of the
same Divine materials,&mdash;wrought in the same heavenly loom.
</p>

<p>
It was even to have been expected, from what is found
to have been universally the method in other parts of Scripture,&mdash;(for
it was of course foreseen by <hi rend="smallcaps">Almighty God</hi>
from the beginning that this portion of His Word would
be, like its Divine Author, in these last days cavilled at, reviled,
hated, rejected, denied,)&mdash;that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Spirit</hi> would not
leave Himself without witness in this place. It was to have
been anticipated, I say, that Eternal Wisdom would carefully&mdash;(I
trust there is no irreverence in so speaking of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>
and His ways!)&mdash;would carefully make provision: meet the
coming unbelief (as His Angel met Balaam) with a drawn
sword: plant up and down throughout these Twelve Verses
of the Gospel, sure indications of their Divine Original,&mdash;unmistakable
notes of purpose and design,&mdash;mysterious traces
and tokens of Himself; not visible indeed to the scornful
and arrogant, the impatient and irreverent; yet clear as if
written with a sunbeam to the patient and humble student,
the man who <q>trembleth at <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi>
Word.</q><note place="foot">Is. lxvi. 2.</note> Or, (if the
Reader prefers the image,) the indications of a Divine Original
to be met with in these verses shall be likened rather
to those cryptic characters, invisible so long as they remain
unsuspected, but which shine forth clear and strong when
exposed to the Light or to the Heat; (Light and Heat, both
emblems of Himself!) so that even he that gropeth in darkness
must now see them, and admit that of a truth <q>the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> is in this place</q> although he <q>knew it not!</q>
</p>

<p>
(i.) I propose then that in the first instance we compare
the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel with the beginning of it.
We did this before, when our object was to ascertain whether
<pb n="182"/><anchor id="Pg182"/>
the <emph>Style</emph> of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 be indeed as utterly discordant
from that of the rest of the Gospel as is commonly
represented. We found, instead, the most striking resemblance.<note place="foot">See
above, p. <ref target="Pg143">143-5</ref>.</note>
We also instituted a brief comparison between
the two in order to discover whether the <emph>Diction</emph> of the one
might not possibly be found as suggestive of <emph>verbal</emph> doubts
as the diction of the other: and so we found it.<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg174">174-5</ref>.</note>&mdash;Let us
for the third time draw the two extremities of this precious
fabric into close proximity in order again to compare them.
Nothing I presume can be fairer than to elect that, once
more, our attention be chiefly directed to what is contained
within the twelve verses (ver. 9-20) of S. Mark's <emph>first</emph> chapter
which exactly correspond with the twelve verses of his <emph>last</emph>
chapter (ver. 9-20) which are the subject of the present volume.
</p>

<p>
Now between these two sections of the Gospel, besides
(1) the obvious <emph>verbal</emph> resemblance, I detect (2) a singular

much stress. Yet are they certainly not without argumentative

<p>
Now this, to say the least, shews that there exists an
unmistakable relation of sympathy between the first page of
<pb n="183"/><anchor id="Pg183"/>
S. Mark's Gospel and the last. The same doctrinal phraseology,<note place="foot">My
attention was first drawn to this by my friend, the Rev. W. Kay, D.D.</note>&mdash;the
same indications of Divine purpose,&mdash;the same
prevailing cast of thought is observed to occur in both.
(i.) <emph>A Gospel</emph> to be everywhere <emph>preached</emph>;&mdash;(ii.)
<emph>Faith</emph>, to be of all required;&mdash;(iii.) <emph>Baptism</emph> to be
universally administered; <q>one <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>, one Faith, one
Baptism:</q>&mdash;Is not <emph>this</emph> the
theme of the beginning of S. Mark's Gospel as well as of
the end of it? Surely it is as if on comparing the two extremities
of a chain, with a view to ascertaining whether
the fabric be identical or not, it were discovered that those
extremities are even meant <emph>to clasp</emph>!
</p>

<p>
(2.) But the <emph>essential</emph> parallelism between S. Mark xvi. 9-20
and S. Mark i. 9-20 is a profounder phenomenon and
deserves even more attention. I proceed to set down side
by side, as before, what ought to require neither comment
nor explanation of mine. Thus we find,&mdash;

<p>
It is surely not an unmeaning circumstance, a mere accident,
that the Evangelist should at the very outset and at
the very conclusion of his Gospel, so express himself! If, however,
it should seem to the Reader a mere matter of course,
a phenomenon without interest or significancy,&mdash;nothing
which I could add would probably bring him to a different
mind.
</p>

<p>
(3.) Then, further: when I scrutinize attentively the two
portions of Scripture thus proposed for critical survey, I am
not a little struck by the discovery that the VIth Article
of the ancient Creed of Jerusalem (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 348) is found in the
one: the Xth Article, in the other.<note place="foot"><p>The Creed itself, (<q>ex
variis Cyrillianarum Catacheseon locis collectum,</q>) may be seen at p. 84 of De
Touttée's ed. of Cyril. Let the following be compared:&mdash;

be seen at p. 295 <hi rend="smallcaps">C</hi> of Cyril.
</p>
<p>
The point will be most intelligently and instructively studied in Professor
Heurtley's little work <hi rend='italic'>De Fide et Symbolo</hi>, 1869, p. 9.
</p></note> If it be a purely fortuitous
<pb n="185"/><anchor id="Pg185"/>
circumstance, that two cardinal verities like these,&mdash;(viz.
<q><emph>He ascended into Heaven, and sat down at the Right
Hand of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi></emph></q>&mdash;and <q><emph>One Baptism for the
Remission of sins</emph>,</q>)
should be found at either extremity of one short Gospel,&mdash;I
will but point out that it is certainly one of a very remarkable
series of fortuitous circumstances.&mdash;But in the
thing to be mentioned next, there neither is, nor can be,
any talk of fortuitousness at all.
</p>

<p>
(4.) Allusion is made to the diversity of Name whereby
the Son of Man is indicated in these two several places of
the Gospel; which constitutes a most Divine circumstance,
and is profoundly significant. He who in <emph>the first</emph> verse
(S. Mark i. 1) was designated by the joint title <q>Ἰησοῦς</q>
and <q>Χριστός,</q>&mdash;here, in the last two verses (S. Mark xvi.
19, 20) is styled for the first and for the last time, <q>Ὁ ΚΥΡΙΟΣ</q>&mdash;the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.<note place="foot">See above,&mdash;p.
<ref target="Pg165">165-6</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
And why? Because He who at His Circumcision was
named <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi>,</q> (a Name which was given Him from
<emph>His Birth</emph>, yea, and before His Birth); He who at His Baptism
became <q>the <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi>,</q> (a Title which belonged to
<emph>His Office</emph>, and which betokens His sacred <emph>Unction</emph>);&mdash;the
same, on the occasion of His Ascension into Heaven and Session at the
Right Hand of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>,&mdash;when (as we know) <q>all power had
been given unto Him in Heaven and in Earth</q> (S. Matth.
xxviii. 18),&mdash;is designated by His Name of <emph>Dominion</emph>; <q>the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi></q> <hi rend="smallcaps">Jehovah</hi> ... <q>Magnifica
et opportuna appellatio!</q>&mdash;as Bengel well remarks.
</p>

<p>
But I take leave to point out that all this is what never
either would or could have entered into the mind of a fabricator
of a conclusion to S. Mark's unfinished Gospel. No
inventor of a supplement, I say, <emph>could</emph> have planted his foot
in this way in exactly the right place. The proof of my
assertion is twofold:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) First, because the present indication that the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Holy Ghost</hi> was indeed the Author of these last Twelve Verses
is even appealed to by Dr. Davidson and his School, <emph>as
a proof of a spurious original</emph>. Verily, such Critics do not
recognise the token of the Divine Finger even when they <emph>see</emph> it!
</p>

<pb n="186"/><anchor id="Pg186"/>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Next, as a matter of fact, we <emph>have</emph>
a spurious Supplement to the Gospel,&mdash;the same which was exhibited above
at p. <ref target="Pg123">123-4</ref>; and which may here be with advantage reproduced
in its Latin form:&mdash;<q>Omnia autem quaecumque praecepta
erant illis qui cum Petro erant, breviter exposuerunt.
Post haec et ipse Iesus adparuit, et ab oriente usque in
occidentem misit per illos sanctam et incorruptam praedicationem
salutis aeternae. Amen.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Cod. Bobbiensis</hi>
(k): which however for <q>illis</q> has <q>et:</q> for <q>Petro,</q>
<q>puero:</q> and for <q>occidentem,</q> <q>orientem.</q> It also repeats <q>usque.</q>
I have ventured to alter <q>ab orientem</q> into <q>ab oriente.</q>&mdash;Compare what
is found in the Philoxenian margin, as given by White and Adler.</note>&mdash;Another
apocryphal termination is found in certain copies of the Thebaic version.
It occupies the place of ver. 20, and is as follows:&mdash;<q>Exeuntes
terni in quatuor climata caeli praedicarunt Evangelium
in mundo toto, <hi rend="smallcaps">Christo</hi> operante cum iis in verbo confirmationem
cum signis sequentibus eos et miraculis. Atque
hoc modo cognitum est regnum Dei in terra tota et in
mundo toto Israelis in testimonium gentium omnium harum
quae exsistunt ab oriente ad occasum.</q> It will be seen
that the Title of <emph>Dominion</emph> (ὁ Κύριος&mdash;the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>) is found
in neither of these fabricated passages; but the Names of
<emph>Nativity</emph> and of <emph>Baptism</emph>
(Ἰησοῦς and Χριστός&mdash;<hi rend="smallcaps">Jesus</hi> and
<hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi>) occur instead.
</p>

<p>
(ii.) Then further:&mdash;It is an extraordinary note of
genuineness that such a vast number of minute but important
facts should be found accumulated within the narrow
compass of these twelve verses; and should be met with
<emph>nowhere else</emph>. The writer,&mdash;supposing that he had only
S. Matthew's Gospel before him,&mdash;traverses (except in one
single instance) <emph>wholly new ground</emph>; moves forward with
unmistakable boldness and a rare sense of security; and
wherever he plants his foot, it is to enrich the soil with
fertility and beauty. But on the supposition that he wrote
after S. Luke's and S. John's Gospel had appeared,&mdash;the
marvel becomes increased an hundred-fold: for how then
does it come to pass that he evidently draws his information
from quite independent sources? is not bound by any of
their statements? even seems <emph>purposely</emph> to break away from
their guidance, and to adventure some extraordinary statement
<pb n="187"/><anchor id="Pg187"/>
of his own,&mdash;which nevertheless carries the true Gospel
savour with it; and is felt to be authentic from the very
circumstance that no one would have ever dared to invent
such a detail and put it forth on his own responsibility?
</p>

<p>
(iii.) Second to no indication that this entire section of
the Gospel has a Divine original, I hold to be a famous
expression which (like πρώτη σαββάτου) has occasioned
general offence: I mean, the designation of Mary Magdalene
as one <q>out of whom</q> the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> <q>had cast seven
devils;</q> and <emph>that</emph>, in immediate connexion with the record of her
august privilege of being the first of the Human Race to
behold His risen form. There is such profound Gospel significancy;&mdash;such
sublime improbability,&mdash;such exquisite
pathos in this record,&mdash;that I would defy any fabricator, be
he who he might, to have achieved it. This has been to
some extent pointed out already.<note place="foot">See above (Art. II.) p.
<ref target="Pg152">152-3</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
(iv.) It has also been pointed out, (but the circumstance
must be by all means here insisted upon afresh,) that the designation
(found in ver. 10) of the little company of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
followers,&mdash;<q>τοῖς μετ᾽ αὐτοῦ γενομένοις,</q>&mdash;is another rare
note of veracious origin. No one but S. Mark,&mdash;or just such
an one as he,&mdash;would or could have so accurately designated
the little band of Christian men and women who, unconscious
of their bliss, were <q>mourning and weeping</q> till after
sunrise on the first Easter Day. The reader is reminded of
what has been already offered on this subject, at p. <ref target="Pg155">155-6</ref>.
</p>

<p>
(v.) I venture further to point out that no writer but
S. Mark, (or such an one as he<note place="foot">Consider S. Luke xxiv. 9: 33.
Acts ii. 14.</note>), would have familiarly designated
the Apostolic body as <q>αὐτοῖς τοῖς ἔνδεκα,</q> in ver. 14.
The phrase οἱ δώδεκα, he uses in proportion <emph>far</emph> oftener than
any other two of the Evangelists.<note place="foot">S. Matth. xxvi. 14, 29,
47.&mdash;S. Mark iv. 10: vi. 7: ix. 35: x. 32: xi. 11:
xiv. 10, 17, 20, 43.&mdash;S. Luke viii. 1: ix. 1, 12: xviii. 31: xxii. 8, 47.&mdash;S.
John vi. 37, 70, 71: xx. 24.</note> And it is evident that
the phrase οἱ ἕνδεκα soon became an equally recognised designation
of the Apostolic body,&mdash;<q>from which Judas by
transgression fell.</q> Its familiar introduction into this place
by the second Evangelist is exactly what one might have
<pb n="188"/><anchor id="Pg188"/>
looked for, or at least what one is fully prepared to meet
with, <emph>in him</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(vi.) I will close this enumeration by calling attention to
an unobtrusive and unobserved verb in the last of these
verses which (I venture to say) it would never have entered
into the mind of any ordinary writer to employ in that
particular place. I allude to the familiar word ἐξελθόντες.
</p>

<p>
The precise meaning of the expression,&mdash;depending on the
known force of the preposition with which the verb is
compounded,&mdash;can scarcely be missed by any one who, on
the one hand, is familiar with the Evangelical method;
on the other, is sufficiently acquainted with the Gospel
History. Reference is certainly made to the final departure
of the Apostolic body <emph>out of the city of
Jerusalem</emph>.<note place="foot">Compare S. Luke xxii. 39; and especially S.
John xviii. 1,&mdash;where the moment of departure <emph>from the city</emph> is marked:
(for observe, they had left the house and the upper chamber at ch. xiv. 31). See also
ch. xix. 17,&mdash;where the going <emph>without the gate</emph> is indicated: (for
ἔξω τῆς πύλης ἔπαθε [Heb. xiii. 12.]) So Matth. xxvii. 32. Consider S. Luke xxi.
37.</note> And tacitly, beyond a question, there is herein contained a recollection
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> command to His Apostles, twice
expressly recorded by S. Luke, <q>that they should <emph>not depart from
Jerusalem</emph>, but wait for the promise of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Father</hi>.</q>
<q>Behold,</q> (said He,) <q>I send the promise of My <hi rend="smallcaps">Father</hi>
upon you: but <emph>tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem</emph>, until ye be
endued with power from on high.</q><note place="foot">S. Luke xxiv. 49. Acts i.
4.</note>... After many days <q><emph>they went forth</emph></q> or
<q><emph>out</emph>.</q> S. Mark, (or perhaps it is
rather S. Peter,) expressly says so,&mdash;ἐξελθόντες. Aye, and
<emph>that</emph> was a memorable <q>outgoing,</q> truly! What else was
its purpose but the evangelization of the World?
</p>

<p>
VII. Let this suffice, then, concerning the evidence derived
from Internal considerations. But lest it should hereafter
be reckoned as an omission, and imputed to me as
a fault, that I have said nothing about the alleged <emph>Inconsistency</emph>
of certain statements contained in these <q>Twelve
Verses</q> with the larger notices contained in the parallel
narratives of S. Luke and S. John,&mdash;I proceed briefly to
explain <emph>why</emph> I am silent on this head.
</p>

<p>
1. I cannot see for whom I should be writing; in other
<pb n="189"/><anchor id="Pg189"/>
words,&mdash;what I should propose to myself as the end to be
attained by what I wrote. For,
</p>

<p>
2. What would be gained by demonstrating,&mdash;(as I am
of course prepared to do,)&mdash;that there is really <emph>no inconsistency
whatever</emph> between anything which S. Mark here says,
and what the other Evangelists deliver? I should have
proved that,&mdash;(assuming the <emph>other</emph> Evangelical narratives to
be authentic, i.e. historically true,)&mdash;the narrative before us
cannot be objected to on the score of its not being authentic
also. But <emph>by whom</emph> is such proof required?
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) Not by the men who insist that errors are occasionally
to be met with in the Evangelical narratives. In <emph>their</emph> estimation,
<emph>the genuineness of an inspired writing</emph> is a thing not
in the least degree rendered suspicious by the erroneousness
of its statements. According to them, the narrative may
exhibit inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and may yet be the
work of S. Mark. If the inconsistencies be but <q>trifling,</q>
and the inaccuracies <q>minute,</q>&mdash;these <q>sound Theologians,</q>
(for so they style themselves,<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg002">2</ref>.</note>) <q>have no dread whatever
of acknowledging</q> their existence. Be it so. Then would
it be a gratuitous task to set about convincing <emph>them</emph> that
no inconsistency, no inaccuracy is discoverable within the
compass of these Twelve concluding Verses.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) But neither is such proof required by faithful Readers;
who, for want of the requisite Scientific knowledge, are
unable to discern the perfect Harmony of the Evangelical
narratives in this place. It is only one of many places
where a primâ facie discrepancy, though it does not fail to
strike,&mdash;yet (happily) altogether fails to distress them.
Consciously or unconsciously, such readers reason with themselves
somewhat as follows:&mdash;"<hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Word,
like all <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi>
other Works, (and I am taught to regard <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Word as
a very masterpiece of creative skill;)&mdash;the blessed Gospel,
I say, is <emph>full</emph> of difficulties. And yet those difficulties are
observed invariably to disappear under competent investigation.
Can I seriously doubt that if sufficient critical skill
were brought to bear on the highly elliptical portion of narrative
contained in these Twelve Verses, it would present no
<pb n="190"/><anchor id="Pg190"/>
exception to a rule which is observed to be else universal;
and that any apparent inconsistency between S. Mark's
statements in this place, and those of S. Luke and S. John,
would also be found to be imaginary only?"
</p>

<p>
This then is the reason why I abstain from entering upon
a prolonged Inquiry, which would in fact necessitate a discussion
of <emph>the Principles of Gospel Harmony</emph>,&mdash;for which the
present would clearly not be the proper place.
</p>

<p>
VIII. Let it suffice that, in the foregoing pages,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. I have shewn that the supposed argument from <q>Style,</q>
(in itself a highly fallacious test,) disappears under investigation.
</p>

<p>
It has been proved (pp. <ref target="Pg142">142-5</ref>) that, on the contrary, the
style of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is exceedingly like the style of
S. Mark i. 9-20; and therefore, that <emph>it is rendered probable
by the Style</emph> that the Author of the beginning of this Gospel
was also the Author of the end of it.
</p>

<p>
2. I have further shewn that the supposed argument
from <q>Phraseology,</q>&mdash;(in itself, a most unsatisfactory test;
and as it has been applied to the matter in hand, a very
coarse and clumsy one;)&mdash;breaks down hopelessly under
severe analysis.
</p>

<p>
Instead of there being twenty-seven suspicious circumstances
in the Phraseology of these Twelve Verses, it has
been proved (pp. <ref target="Pg170">170-3</ref>) that in twenty-seven particulars there
emerge <emph>corroborative considerations</emph>.
</p>

<p>
3. Lastly, I have shewn that a loftier method of Criticism
is at hand; and that, tested by this truer, more judicious,
and more philosophical standard; <emph>a presumption</emph> of the highest
order is created <emph>that these Verses must needs be the work
of S. Mark</emph>.

I have reserved for the last the testimony of <hi rend="smallcaps">the Lectionaries</hi>,
which has been hitherto all but entirely overlooked;<note place="foot">The one
memorable exception, which I have only lately met with, is supplied
by the following remark of the thoughtful and accurate Matthaei, made
in a place where it was almost safe to escape attention; viz. in a footnote

by without so much as a word of comment,
by those who have preceded me in this inquiry. Yet is it,
when rightly understood, altogether decisive of the question
at issue. And why? Because it is not the testimony rendered
by a solitary father or by a solitary MS.; no, nor
even the testimony yielded by a single Church, or by
a single family of MSS. But it is <emph>the united testimony of all
the Churches</emph>. It is therefore the evidence borne by a <q>goodly
fellowship of Prophets,</q> a <q>noble array of Martyrs</q> indeed;
as well as by <emph>MSS. innumerable which have long since
perished</emph>, but which must of necessity once have been. And
so, it comes to us like the voice of many waters: dates, (as
I shall shew by-and-by,) from a period of altogether immemorial
antiquity: is endorsed by the sanction of all the succeeding
ages: admits of neither doubt nor evasion. This
subject, in order that it may be intelligibly handled, will be
<pb n="192"/><anchor id="Pg192"/>
most conveniently approached by some remarks which shall
rehearse the matter from the beginning.
</p>

<p>
The Christian Church succeeded to the Jewish. The
younger society inherited the traditions of the elder, not less
as a measure of necessity than as a matter of right; and by
a kind of sacred instinct conformed itself from the very beginning
in countless particulars to its divinely-appointed
model. The same general Order of Service went on unbroken,&mdash;conducted
by a Priesthood whose spiritual succession
was at least as jealously guarded as had been the natural
descent from Aaron in the Church of the Circumcision.<note place="foot">Τὰς τῶν ἱερῶν
ἀποστόλων διαδοχάς,&mdash;are <emph>the first words</emph> of the Ecclesiatical
History of Eusebius.</note> It
was found that <q>the Sacraments of the Jews are [but] types
of ours.</q><note place="foot">See the heading of 1 Cor. x. in our Authorised
Version.</note> Still were David's Psalms antiphonally recited,
and the voices of <q>Moses and the Prophets</q> were heard in
the sacred assemblies of God's people <q>every Sabbath day.</q>
Canticle succeeded to Canticle; while many a Versicle simply
held its ground. The congenial utterances of the chosen
race passed readily into the service of the family of the redeemed.
Unconsciously perhaps, the very method of the
one became adopted by the other: as, for example, the method
of beginning a festival from the <q>Eve</q> of the preceding
Day. The Synagogue-worship became transfigured;
but it did not part with one of its characteristic features.
Above all, the same three great Festivals were still retained
which declare <q>the rock whence we are hewn and the hole
of the pit whence we are digged:</q> only was it made a question,
a controversy rather, whether Easter should or should
not be celebrated <emph>with the Jews</emph>.<note place="foot">See Bingham's
<hi rend='italic'>Origines</hi>, Book xx. ch. v. §§ 2, 3, 4.</note>
</p>

<p>
But it is the faithful handing on to the Christian community
of <emph>the Lectionary practice</emph> of the Synagogue to which the
reader's attention is now exclusively invited. That the Christian
Church inherited from the Jewish the practice of reading
a first and a second Lesson in its public assemblies, is
demonstrable. What the Synagogue practice was in the
time of the Apostles is known from Acts xiii. 15, 27. Justin
<pb n="193"/><anchor id="Pg193"/>
Martyr, (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 150) describes the Christian practice in his
time as precisely similar:<note place="foot">Τῇ τοῦ ἡλίου λεγομένῃ ἡμέρᾳ, πάντων
κατὰ πόλεις ἥ ἀγροὺς μενόντων ἐπὶ τὸ αὐτὸ συνέλευσις γίνεται, καὶ τὰ ἀπομνημονεύματα
τῶν ἀποστόλων, ἤ τὰ συγγράμματα τῶν προφητῶν ἀναγινώσκεται, μέχρις ἐγχωρεῖ. Then
came the Sermon,&mdash;then, all stood and prayed,&mdash;then followed Holy
Communion.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Apol.</hi> i. c. 67,

Lessons) in one of his Homilies.<note place="foot">ὁ μάτην ἐνταῦθα εἰσελθὼν, εἰπὲ,

in Egypt, after the Twelve Prayers at Vespers and at Matins,
two Lessons were read, one out of the Old Testament and
the other out of the New. But <emph>on Saturdays</emph> and <emph>Sundays</emph>,
and the fifty days of Pentecost, both Lessons were from the
New Testament,&mdash;one from the Epistles or the Acts of the
Apostles; the other, from the Gospels.<note place="foot">Cassian
writes,&mdash;<q>Venerabilis Patrum senatus ... decrevit hunc numerum
[sc. duodecim Orationum] tam in Vespertinis quam in Nocturnis conventiculis

practice seems to bear a striking resemblance to that of the
Christian Church at the earliest period: for we hear of (1)
<q>Moses and the Prophets,</q> (which will have been the carrying

first and second Lesson,)&mdash;(2) a lesson out of the <q>Epistles

It is, in fact, universally received that the Eastern Church
has, from a period of even Apostolic antiquity, enjoyed a Lectionary,&mdash;or
established system of Scripture lessons,&mdash;of her
own. In its conception, this Lectionary is discovered to
have been fashioned (as was natural) upon the model of the
Lectionary of God's ancient people, the Jews: for it commences,
as theirs did, <emph>in the autumn</emph>, (in September<note place="foot">See
Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, p. 74, and the reff. in note (k)
overleaf.</note>); and
<pb n="194"/><anchor id="Pg194"/>
prescribes two immovable <q>Lections</q> for every <emph>Saturday</emph> (as
well as for every Sunday) in the year: differing chiefly in
this,&mdash;that the prominent place which had been hitherto assigned
to <q>the Law and the Prophets,</q><note place="foot">English readers may be referred
to Horne's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. (<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi>

the preface to Van der Hooght's <hi rend='italic'>Hebrew Bible</hi>,
(<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1705) § 35: in connexion with which, see vol. ii. p.

enjoyed by the Gospels and the Apostolic writings. <q>Saturday-Sunday</q>
lections&mdash;(σαββατοκυριακαί, for so these Lections
were called,)&mdash;retain their place in the <q>Synaxarium</q>
of the East to the present hour. It seems also a singular note
of antiquity that the Sabbath and the Sunday succeeding it
do as it were cohere, and bear one appellation; so that the
week takes its name&mdash;<emph>not</emph> from the Sunday with which it
commences,<note place="foot">Thus, the κυριακή τῆς τυροφάγου is <q>Quinquagesima

<emph>it concludes</emph>. To mention only one out of a hundred minute
traits of identity which the public Service of the sanctuary
retained:&mdash;Easter Eve, which from the earliest period to
this day has been called <q>μέγα σάββατον,</q><note place="foot">See Suicer's

minutely into the structure of the Oriental Lectionary,&mdash;(some will perhaps
think I have said too much, but the interest of the subject
ought to be a sufficient apology,)&mdash;it is because further details
would be irrelevant to my present purpose; which is
only to call attention to the three following facts:
</p>

<p>
(I.) That the practice in the Christian Church of reading
publicly before the congregation certain fixed portions of
Holy Writ, according to an established and generally received
rule, must have existed from a period long anterior
to the date of any known Greek copy of the New Testament
Scriptures.
</p>

<p>
(II.) That although there happens to be extant neither
<q>Synaxarium,</q> (i.e. Table of Proper Lessons of the Greek
<pb n="195"/><anchor id="Pg195"/>
Church), nor <q>Evangelistarium,</q> (i.e. Book containing the
Ecclesiastical Lections <hi rend='italic'>in extenso</hi>), of higher antiquity than
the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,&mdash;yet
that the scheme itself, as exhibited by those monuments,&mdash;certainly in every
essential particular,&mdash;is older than any known Greek MS. which contains
it, by <emph>at least</emph> four, in fact by full <emph>five</emph> hundred years.
</p>

<p>
(III.) Lastly,&mdash;That in the said Lectionaries of the
Greek and of the Syrian Churches, the twelve concluding
verses of S. Mark which are the subject of discussion throughout
the present pages are observed <emph>invariably</emph> to occupy the
same singularly conspicuous, as well as most honourable
place.
</p>

<p>
I. The first of the foregoing propositions is an established
fact. It is at least quite certain that in the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century (if not long before) there existed
a known Lectionary system, alike in the Church of the East and of the West. Cyril of
Jerusalem (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 348,) having to speak about our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>'s Ascension, remarks that by a providential coincidence,
on the previous day, which was Sunday, the event had formed the
subject of the appointed lessons;<note place="foot"><p>Καὶ ἡ μὲν ἀκολουθία τῆς
διδασκαλίας [cf. Cyril, p. 4, lines 16-7] τῆς πίστεως προέτρεπεν εἰπεῖν καὶ τὰ περὶ
τῆς Ἀναλήψεως: ἀλλ᾽ ἡ τοῦ Θεοῦ χάρις ᾠκονόμησε πληρέστατά σε ἀκοῦσαι, κατὰ τὴν
ἡμετέραν ἀσθένειαν, τῇ χθὲς ἡμέρᾳ κατὰ τῆν Κυριακήν: κατ᾽ οἰκονομίαν τῆς θείας
χάριτος, ἐν τῇ Συνάξει τῆς τῶν ἀναγνωσμάτων ἀκολουθίας τὰ περὶ τῆς εἰς οὐρανοὺς
ἀνόδου τοῦ Σωτῆρος ἡμῶν περιεχούσης: ἐλέγετο δὲ τὰ λεγόμενα, μάλιστα μὲν διὰ πάντας,
καὶ διὰ τὸ τῶν πιστῶν ὁμοῦ πλῆθος: ἐξαιρέτως δὲ διά σε: ζητεῖται δὲ εἰ προσέσχες τοῖς
λεγομένοις. Οἶδας γὰρ ὅτι ἡ ἀκολουθία τῆς Πίστεως διδάσκει σε πιστεύειν εἰς ΤΟΝ
ἈΝΑΣΤΑΝΤΑ ΤΗ ΤΡΙΤΗ ΗΜΕΡΑ: ΚΑΙ ἈΝΕΛΘΟΝΤΑ ΕΙΣ ΤΟΥΣ ΟΥΡΑΝΟΥΣ, ΚΑΙ ΚΑΘΙΣΑΝΤΑ ἘΚ
ΔΕΞΙΩΝ ΤΟΥ ΠΑΤΡΟΣ&mdash;μάλιστα μὲν οὖν μνημονεύειν σε νομίζω τῆς ἐξηγήσεως.
πλὴν ἐν παραδρομῇ καὶ νῦν ὑπομιμνήσκω σε τῶν εἰρημένων. (Cyril. Hier.
<hi rend='italic'>Cat.</hi> xiv. c. 24. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> p. 217
<hi rend="smallcaps">C, D</hi>.)&mdash;Of that Sermon of his, Cyril again and again
reminds his auditory. Μέμνησο δὲ καὶ τῶν εἰρημένων μοι πολλάκις περὶ τοῦ, ἐκ
δεξιῶν τοῦ πατρος καθέζεσθαι τὸν Υἱὸν,&mdash;he says, <hi rend='italic'>ibid.</hi> p.
219 <hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>. A little lower down, Νῦν δὲ ὑμᾶς ὑπομνηστέον ὀλίγων,
τῶν ἐκ πολλῶν εἰρημένων περὶ τοῦ, ἐκ δειξῶν τοῦ Πατρὸς καθέζεσθαι τὸν
Υἱόν.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> <hi rend="smallcaps">D</hi>.
</p>
<p>
From this it becomes plain <emph>why Cyril nowhere quotes S. Mark</emph> xvi.
19,&mdash;<emph>or S. Luke</emph> xxiv. 51,&mdash;<emph>or Acts</emph> i. 9.
He must needs have enlarged upon those three <emph>inevitable</emph> places of
Scripture, the day before.
</p></note> and that he had availed
himself of the occasion to discourse largely on the subject.&mdash;Chrysostom,
preaching at Antioch, makes it plain that, in
<pb n="196"/><anchor id="Pg196"/>
the latter part of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, the
order of the lessons which were publicly read in the Church <emph>on Saturdays and
Sundays</emph><note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg193">193</ref> and p.
<ref target="Pg194">194</ref>.</note> was familiarly known to the congregation: for he
invites them to sit down, and study attentively beforehand,
at home, the Sections (περικοπάς) of the Gospel which they
were about to hear in Church.<note place="foot">Ὥστε δὲ εὐμαθέστερον γενέσθαι τὸν

on Good Friday had given general offence.<note place="foot">The place will be found
quoted below, p. <ref target="Pg202">202</ref>, note (o).</note>&mdash;Now
by these few notices, to look no further, it is rendered certain
that a Lectionary system of <emph>some</emph> sort must have been
in existence at a period long anterior to the date of any copy
of the New Testament Scriptures extant. I shall shew
by-and-by that the fact is established by the Codices (B,
א, A, C, D) themselves.
</p>

<p>
But we may go back further yet; for not only Eusebius,
but Origen and Clemens Alexandrinus, by their habitual
use of the technical term for an Ecclesiastical Lection (περικοπή,
ἀνάγνωσις, ἀνάγνωσμα,) remind us that the Lectionary
practice of the East was already established in
their days.<note place="foot">See Suicer, (i. 247 and 9: ii. 673). He is much more
full and satisfactory than Scholz, whose remarks, nevertheless, deserve attention,
(<hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> vol. i, Prolegg. p. xxxi.) See also above, p.
<ref target="Pg045">45</ref>, notes (r) and (s).</note>
</p>

<p>
II. The Oriental Lectionary consists of <q>Synaxarion</q>
and <q>Eclogadion,</q> (or Tables of Proper Lessons from the
Gospels and Apostolic writings daily throughout the year;)
<pb n="197"/><anchor id="Pg197"/>
together with <q>Menologion,</q> (or Calendar of immovable
Festivals and Saints' Days.) That we are thoroughly acquainted
with all of these, as exhibited in Codices of the
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> and
x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> centuries,&mdash;is a familiar fact;
in illustration of which it is enough to refer the reader to the
works cited at the foot of the page.<note place="foot"><p>At the beginning of every
volume of the first ed. of his <hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (Riga, 1788) Matthaei
has laboriously <emph>edited</emph> the <q>Lectiones Ecclesiasticæ</q> of the
Greek Church. See also his Appendices,&mdash;viz. vol. ii. pp. 272-318 and 322-363.
His 2nd ed. (Wittenberg, 1803,) is distinguished by the valuable peculiarity
of indicating the Ecclesiastical sections throughout, in the manner of
an ancient MS.; and that, with extraordinary fulness and accuracy. His Συναχάρια
(i. 723-68 and iii. 1-24) though not intelligible perhaps to ordinary
readers, are very important. He derived them from MSS. which he designates
<q>B</q> and <q>H,</q> but which are <emph>our</emph> <q>Evstt. 47 and
50,</q>&mdash;uncial Evangelistaria of the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century (See Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introd.</hi> p. 214.)
</p>
<p>
Scholz, at the end of vol. i. of his N. T. p. 453-93, gives in full the <q>Synaxarium</q>
and <q>Menologium</q> of Codd. K and M, (viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
or ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century.)
See also his vol. ii. pp. 456-69. Unfortunately, (as Scrivener recognises,
p. 110,) all here is carelessly done,&mdash;as usual with this Editor; and therefore
to a great extent useless. His slovenliness is extraordinary. The <q>Gospels
of the Passion</q> (τῶν ἁγίων πάθων), he entitles τῶν ἁγίων πάντων (p. 472);
and so throughout.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Scrivener (<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, pp. 68-75,) has given by far the
most intelligible account of this matter, by exhibiting <emph>in English</emph> the
Lectionary of the Eastern Church, (<q>gathered chiefly from Evangelist. Arund. 547,
Parham 18, Harl. 5598, Burney 22, and Christ's Coll. Camb.</q>); and supplying the
references to Scripture in the ordinary way. See, by all means, his
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, pp. 62-65: also, pp. 211-225.
</p></note> But it is no less certain
that the scheme of Proper Lessons itself is of much
higher antiquity.
</p>

<p>
1. The proof of this, if it could only be established by an
induction of particular instances, would not only be very
tedious, but also very difficult indeed. It will be perceived,
on reflection, that even when the occasion of a Homily (suppose)
is actually recorded, the Scripture references which
it contains, apart from the Author's statement that what
he quotes <emph>had</emph> formed part of that day's Service, creates
scarcely so much as a presumption of the fact: while the
correspondence, however striking, between such references
to Scripture and the Lectionary as we have it, is of course
no proof whatever that we are so far in possession of the
Lectionary of the Patristic age. Nay, on famous Festivals,
<pb n="198"/><anchor id="Pg198"/>
the employment of certain passages of Scripture is, in
a manner, inevitable,<note place="foot"><p>Consider the following:&mdash;Ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ
τοῦ σταυροῦ τὰ περὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ πάντα ἀναγινώσκομεν. ἐν τῷ σαββάτῳ τῷ μεγάλῳ πάλιν,
ὅτι παρεδόθη ἡμῶν ὁ Κύριος, ὅτι ἐσταυρώθη, ὅτι ἀπέθανε τὸ κατὰ σάρκα, ὅτι ἐτάφη:
τίνος οὖν ἕνεκεν καὶ τὰς πράξεις τῶν ἀποστόλων οὐ μετὰ τὴν πεντηκοστὴν ἀναγινώσκομεν,
ὅτε καὶ ἐγένοντο, καὶ ἀρχὴν ἔλαβον;&mdash;Chrys. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 88.
</p>
<p>
Again:&mdash;εἰ γὰρ τότε ἥρξαντο ποιεῖν τὰ σημεῖα οἱ ἀπόστολοι, ἤγουν μετὰ τὴν
κυρίου ἀνάστασιν, τότε ἔδει καὶ τὸ βιβλίον ἀναγινώσκεσθαι τοῦτο. ὥσπερ γὰρ τὰ
περὶ τοῦ σταυροῦ ἐν τῇ ἡμέρᾳ σταυροῦ ἀναγινώσκομεν, καὶ τὰ ἐν τῇ ἀναστάσει
ὁμοίως, καὶ τὰ ἐν ἐκάστῃ ἑορτῇ γεγονότα τῇ αὐτῇ πάλιν ἀναγινώσκομεν, οὕτως
ἔδει καὶ τὰ θαύματα τὰ ἀποστολικὰ ἐν ταῖς ἡμέραις τῶν ἀποστολικῶν σημείων
ἀναγινώσκεσθαι.&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> p. 89 <hi rend="smallcaps">D</hi>.
</p></note> and may on no account be pressed.
</p>

<p>
2. Thus, when Chrysostom<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 454
<hi rend="smallcaps">B, D</hi>.</note> and when
Epiphanius,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 290
<hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>.</note> preaching
on Ascension Day, refer to Acts i. 10, 11,&mdash;we do not
feel ourselves warranted to press the coincidence of such
a quotation with the Liturgical section of the day.&mdash;So,
again, when Chrysostom preaches on Christmas Day, and
quotes from S. Matthew ii. 1, 2;<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii.
357 <hi rend="smallcaps">E</hi>.</note> or on Whitsunday, and
quotes from S. John vii. 38 and Acts ii. 3 and 13;&mdash;though
both places form part of the Liturgical sections for the day, no
<emph>proof</emph> results therefrom that either chapter was actually used.
</p>

<p>
3. But we are not reduced to this method. It is discovered
that nearly three-fourths of Chrysostom's Homilies
on S. Matthew either begin at the first verse of <emph>a known
Ecclesiastical Lection</emph>; or else at the first ensuing verse after
the close of one. Thirteen of those Homilies in succession
(the 63rd to the 75th inclusive) begin with <emph>the first words of
as many known Lections</emph>. <q>Let us attend to this delightful
section (περικοπή) which we never cease turning to,</q>&mdash;are
the opening words of Chrysostom's 79th Homily, of which
<q>the text</q> is S. Matth. xxv. 31, i.e. the beginning of the
Gospel for Sexagesima Sunday.&mdash;Cyril of Alexandria's (so
called) <q>Commentary on S. Luke</q> is nothing else but a
series of short Sermons, for the most part delivered on <emph>known
Ecclesiastical Lections</emph>; which does not seem to have been as
yet observed.&mdash;Augustine (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 416) says expressly that he
had handled S. John's Gospel in precisely the same way.<note place="foot"><q>Meminit

4. I proceed, however, to adduce a few distinct proofs that
the existing Lectionary of the great Eastern Church,&mdash;as it
is exhibited by Matthaei, by Scholz, and by Scrivener from
MSS. of the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,&mdash;and
which is contained in Syriac MSS. of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
and vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>&mdash;must needs be in the main
a work of extraordinary antiquity. And if I do not begin
by insisting that at least one century more may be claimed
for it by a mere appeal to the Hierosolymitan Version, it is
only because I will never knowingly admit what may prove
to be untrustworthy materials<note place="foot">See Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, p. 246.</note> into my foundations.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) <q>Every one is aware,</q> (says Chrysostom in a sermon
on our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> Baptism, preached at Antioch,
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 387,)
<q>that this is called the Festival of the Epiphany. Two
manifestations are thereby intended: concerning both of
which <emph>you have heard this day S. Paul discourse in his Epistle
to Titus</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Chrysostom <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii.
369 b, c.&mdash;Compare Scrivener, <hi rend='italic'>ubi supra</hi>, p. 75.</note>
Then follows a quotation from ch. ii. 11 to 13,&mdash;which
proves to be the beginning of the lection for the
day in the Greek Menology. In the time of Chrysostom,
therefore, Titus ii. 11, 12, 13 formed part of one of the
Epiphany lessons,&mdash;as it does to this hour in the Eastern
Church. What is scarcely less interesting, it is also found
to have been part of the Epistle for the Epiphany in the
old Gallican Liturgy,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ed.</hi> Mabillon, p.
116.</note> the affinities of which with the
East are well known.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) Epiphanius (speaking of the Feasts of the Church)
says, that at the Nativity, a Star shewed that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Word</hi>
had become incarnate: at the <q>Theophania</q> (<emph>our</emph> <q>Epiphany</q>)
John cried, <q>Behold the Lamb of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>,</q> &amp;c., and
a Voice from Heaven proclaimed Him at His Baptism. Accordingly,
S. Matth. ii. 1-12 is found to be the ancient
lection for Christmas Day: S. Mark i. 9-11 and S. Matth.
iii. 13-17 the lections for Epiphany. On the morrow, was
read S. John i. 29-34.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) In another of his Homilies, Chrysostom explains with
considerable emphasis the reason why the Book of the Acts
was read publicly in Church during the interval between
Easter and Pentecost; remarking, that it had been the
<pb n="200"/><anchor id="Pg200"/>
liturgical arrangement of a yet earlier
age.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. iii. p. <hi rend="smallcaps">85

βιβλίον τῶν πράξεων τῶν ἀποστόλων ἐν τῷ καιρῷ τῆς πεντηκοστῆς
ἀναγινώσκεται.</note>&mdash;After such an
announcement, it becomes a very striking circumstance that
Augustine also (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 412) should be found to bear witness to
the prevalence of the same liturgical arrangement in the
African Church.<note place="foot"><q>Anniversariâ sollemnitate post passionem Domini
nostis illum librum recitari.</q> <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. (P. ii.) p. 337
<hi rend="smallcaps">g</hi>.</note> In the old Gallican Lectionary, as might
have been expected, the same rule is recognisable. It ought
to be needless to add that the same arrangement is observed
universally to prevail in the Lectionaries both of the East
and of the West to the present hour; although the fact
must have been lost sight of by the individuals who recently,
under pretence of <q><emph>making some advantageous alterations</emph></q>
in our Lectionary, have constructed an entirely new one,&mdash;vicious
in principle and liable to the gravest objections
throughout,&mdash;whereby <emph>this</emph> link also which bound the Church
of England to the practice of Primitive Christendom, has
been unhappily broken; <emph>this</emph> note of Catholicity also has
been effaced.<note place="foot"><p>I desire to leave in this place the permanent record
of my deliberate conviction that the Lectionary which, last year, was hurried
with such indecent haste through Convocation,&mdash;passed in a half-empty House by the
casting vote of the Prolocutor,&mdash;and rudely pressed upon the Church's acceptance by
the Legislature in the course of its present session,&mdash;is the gravest calamity which
has befallen the Church of England for a long time past.
</p>
<p>
Let the history of this Lectionary be remembered.
</p>
<p>
Appointed (in 1867) for an <emph>entirely</emph> different purpose, (viz. the Ornaments
and Vestments question,) 29 Commissioners (14 Clerical and 15 Lay) found
themselves further instructed <q>to suggest and report <emph>whether any and what
alterations and amendments may be advantageously made</emph> in the selection of
Lessons to be read at the time of Divine Service.</q>
</p>
<p>
Thereupon, these individuals,&mdash;(the Liturgical attainments of nine-tenths
of whom it would be unbecoming in such an one as myself to characterise
truthfully,)&mdash;at once imposed upon themselves the duty of inventing <emph>an
entirely new Lectionary for the Church of England</emph>.
</p>
<p>
So to mutilate the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> that it shall henceforth be
quite impossible to understand a single Bible story, or discover the sequence of a
single connected portion of narrative,&mdash;seems to have been the guiding principle of
their deliberations. With reckless eclecticism,&mdash;entire forgetfulness of the
requirements of the poor brother,&mdash;strange disregard for Catholic Tradition and the
claims of immemorial antiquity;&mdash;these Commissioners, (evidently unconscious
of their own unfitness for their self-imposed task,) have given us a Lectionary
which will recommend itself to none but the lovers of novelty,&mdash;the
impatient,&mdash;and the enemies of Divine Truth.
</p>
<p>
That the blame, <emph>the guilt</emph> lies at the door of <emph>our Bishops</emph>,
is certain; but the Church has no one but herself to thank for the injury which has been
thus deliberately inflicted upon her. She has suffered herself to be robbed of her
ancient birthright without resistance; without remonstrance; without (in her
corporate capacity) so much as a word of audible dissatisfaction. <emph>Can</emph> it be
right in this way to defraud those who are to come after us of their lawful
inheritance?... I am amazed and grieved beyond measure at what is taking
place. At least, (as on other occasions,) <hi rend='italic'>liberavi animam meam</hi>.
</p></note>
</p>

<pb n="201"/><anchor id="Pg201"/>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>d</hi>) The purely arbitrary arrangement, (as Mr. Scrivener
phrases it), by which the Book of Genesis, instead of the
Gospel, is appointed to be read<note place="foot">A trace of this remains in the
old Gallican Liturgy,&mdash;pp. 137-8.</note> on the <emph>week</emph> days of Lent,
is discovered to have been fully recognised in the time of
Chrysostom. Accordingly, the two series of Homilies on
the Book of Genesis which that Father preached, he preached
in Lent.<note place="foot">Bingham, xiv. iii. 3.</note>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>e</hi>) It will be seen in the next chapter that it was from
a very remote period the practice of the Eastern Church
to introduce into the lesson for Thursday in Holy-week,
S. Luke's account (ch. xxii. 43, 44) of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> <q>Agony
and bloody Sweat,</q> <emph>immediately after S. Matth.</emph> xxvi. 39.
<emph>That</emph> is, no doubt, the reason why Chrysostom,&mdash;who has
been suspected, (I think unreasonably,) of employing an
Evangelistarium instead of a copy of the Gospels in the
preparation of his Homilies, is observed to quote those same
two verses in that very place in his Homily on S.
Matthew;<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. vii. p. 791 B.</note>
which shews that the Lectionary system of the Eastern
Church in this respect is at least as old as the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>f</hi>) The same two verses used to be <emph>left out</emph>
on the Tuesday after Sexagesima (τῇ γ᾽ τῆς τυροφάγου) for which day S. Luke
xxii. 39-xxiii. 1, is the appointed lection. And <emph>this</emph> explains
why Cyril (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 425) in his Homilies on S. Luke,
passes them by in silence.<note place="foot">See Dean Payne Smith's Translation, p.
863.</note>
</p>

<p>
But we can carry back the witness to the Lectionary practice
of omitting these verses, at least a hundred years; for
<pb n="202"/><anchor id="Pg202"/>
Cod. B, (evidently for that same reason,) <emph>also</emph> omits them,
as was stated above, in p. <ref target="Pg079">79</ref>. They are wanting also in the
Thebaic version, which is of the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>g</hi>) It will be found suggested in the next chapter (page
<ref target="Pg218">218</ref>) that the piercing of our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> side, (S. John xix. 34),&mdash;thrust
into Codd. B and א immediately after S. Matth.
xxvii. 49,&mdash;is probably indebted for its place in those two
MSS. to the Eastern Lectionary practice. If this suggestion
be well founded, a fresh proof is obtained that the Lectionary
of the East was fully established in the beginning
of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century. But see
<ref target="Appendix_H">Appendix (H)</ref>.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>h</hi>) It is a remarkable note of the antiquity of that
Oriental Lectionary system with which we are acquainted,
that S. Matthew's account of the Passion (ch. xxvii. 1-61,)
should be there appointed to be read <emph>alone</emph> on the evening
of Good Friday. Chrysostom clearly alludes to this practice;<note place="foot">κατὰ
τὴν μεγάλην τοῦ Πάσχα ἑσπέραν ταῦτα πάντα ἀναγινώσκεται.&mdash;Chrys.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vii. 818 <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi>.</note>
which Augustine expressly states was also the practice
in his own day.<note place="foot"><q>Passio autem, quia uno die legitur, non solet legi
nisi secundum Matthæum. Voluerain aliquando ut per singulos annos secundum omnes
Evangelistas etiam Passio legeretur. Factum est. Non audierunt homines quod consueverant,
et perturbati sunt.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. v. p. 980
<hi rend="smallcaps">e</hi>.</note> Traces of the same method are
discoverable in the old Gallican
Lectionary.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ed.</hi> Mabillon, pp. 130-5.</note>
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>i</hi>) Epiphanius, (or the namesake of his who was the
author of a well-known Homily on Palm Sunday,) remarks
that <q>yesterday</q> had been read the history of the rising
of Lazarus.<note place="foot">Epiph. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 152-3.</note>
Now S. John xi. 1-45 is the lection for the
antecedent Sabbath, in all the Lectionaries.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>k</hi>) In conclusion, I may be allowed so far to anticipate
what will be found fully established in the next chapter, as
to point out here that since in countless places the text of
our oldest Evangelia as well as the readings of the primitive
Fathers exhibit unmistakable traces of the corrupting
influence of the Lectionary practice, <emph>that</emph> very fact becomes
irrefragable evidence of the antiquity of the Lectionary
which is the occasion of it. Not only must it be more
<pb n="203"/><anchor id="Pg203"/>
ancient than Cod. B or Cod. א, (which are referred to the
beginning of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century), but it must
be older than Origen in the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century, or
the Vetus Itala and the Syriac in the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>.
And thus it is demonstrated, (1st) That fixed
Lessons were read in the Churches of the East in the immediately
post-Apostolic age; and (2ndly) That, wherever
we are able to test it, the Lectionary of that remote period
corresponded with the Lectionary which has come down to
us in documents of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> and
vii<hi rend="vertical-align: syper">th</hi> century, and was in
fact constructed in precisely the same way.
</p>

<p>
I am content in fact to dismiss the preceding instances
with this general remark:&mdash;that a System which is found
to have been fully recognised throughout the East and
throughout the West in the beginning of the fourth century,
<emph>must of necessity have been established very long before</emph>. It is
as when we read of three British Bishops attending the
Council at Arles, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 314. The Church (we say) which
could send out those three Bishops must have been <emph>fully
organized</emph> at a greatly antecedent period.
</p>

<p>
4. Let us attend, however, to the great Festivals of the
Church. These are declared by Chrysostom (in a Homily
delivered at Antioch 20 Dec. <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 386) to be the five
following:&mdash;(1) Nativity: (2) the Theophania: (3) Pascha: (4)
Ascension: (5) Pentecost.<note place="foot">Chrys. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i.
497 <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi>.</note> Epiphanius, his contemporary,
(Bishop of Constantia in the island of Cyprus,) makes the
same enumeration,<note place="foot">Epiph. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 285-6.</note>
in a Homily on the Ascension.<note place="foot"><p>The learned reader will be delighted
and instructed too by the perusal of both passages. Chrysostom declares that
Christmas-Day is the greatest of Festivals; since all the others are but consequences
of the Incarnation.
</p>
<p>
Epiphanius remarks with truth that Ascension-Day is the crowning solemnity
of all: being to the others what a beautiful head is to the human body.
</p></note> In the Apostolical Constitutions, the same five Festivals are
enumerated.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Constt. Apostt.</hi> lib. viii. c. 33.
After the week of the Passion and the week of (1) the Resurrection,&mdash;(2)
Ascension-Day is mentioned;&mdash;(3) Pentecost;&mdash;(4) Nativity;&mdash;(5)
Epiphany. [Note this clear indication that this
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Book of the Constitutions was written
or interpolated at a subsequent date to that commonly assigned to the work.]</note> Let
me state a few Liturgical facts in connexion with each of these.
</p>

<pb n="204"/><anchor id="Pg204"/>

<p>
It is plain that the preceding enumeration could not have
been made at any earlier period: for the Epiphany of our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> and His Nativity were originally but one
Festival.<note place="foot">Bingham's <hi rend='italic'>Origines</hi>, B. xx. c. iv. §
2.</note> Moreover, the circumstances are well known under which
Chrysostom (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 386) announced to his Eastern auditory
that in conformity with what had been correctly ascertained
at Rome, the ancient Festival was henceforth to be
disintegrated.<note place="foot">Chrys. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 355. (See the
<hi rend='italic'>Monitum</hi>, p. 352.)</note>
But this is not material to the present inquiry.
We know that, as a matter of fact, <q>the Epiphanies</q> (for
τὰ ἐπιφανία is the name of the Festival) became in consequence
distributed over Dec. 25 and Jan. 5: our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
<emph>Baptism</emph> being the event chiefly commemorated on the latter
anniversary,<note place="foot">Chrys. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 369
<hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>.</note>&mdash;which used to be chiefly observed in honour
of His <emph>Birth</emph><note place="foot">Epiphanius, Adv. Haer.
<hi rend="smallcaps">li</hi>, c. xvi. (<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> i. 439
<hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>.)</note>&mdash;Concerning the Lessons for Passion-tide and
Easter, as well as concerning those for the Nativity and Epiphany,
something has been offered already; to which may
be added that Hesychius, in the opening sentences of that
<q>Homily</q> which has already engaged so much of our attention,<note place="foot">See
above, pp. <ref target="Pg058">58-9</ref> and <ref target="Pg067">67</ref>.</note>
testifies that the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel was
in his days, as it has been ever since, one of the lections for
Easter. He begins by saying that the Evangelical narratives
of the Resurrection were read on the Sunday night; and
proceeds to reconcile <emph>S. Mark's</emph> with the rest.&mdash;Chrysostom
once and again adverts to the practice of discontinuing the
reading of the Acts after Pentecost,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi>
iii. 102 <hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>. See Bingham on this entire
subject,&mdash;<hi rend="smallcaps">b</hi>. xiv, c. iii.</note>&mdash;which
is observed to be also the method of the Lectionaries.
</p>

<p>
III. I speak separately of the Festival of the Ascension,
for an obvious reason. It ranked, as we have seen, in the
estimation of Primitive Christendom, with the greatest Festivals
of the Church. Augustine, in a well-known passage,
hints that it may have been of Apostolical origin;<note place="foot"><q>Illa quae
non scriptu, sed tradita custodimus, quae quidem toto terrarum
orbe observantur, datur intelligi vel ab ipsis Apostolis, vel plenariis Conciliis
quorum in Ecclesia saluberrima authoritas, commendata atque statuta retineri.
Sicut quod Domini Passio, et Resurrectio, et Ascensio in cœlis, ut Adventus de
cœlo Spiritus Sancti anniversaria sollemnitate
celebrantur.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Ep.</hi> ad Januarium,
(<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> ii. 124 <hi rend="smallcaps">b, c</hi>).</note> so
exceedingly
<pb n="205"/><anchor id="Pg205"/>
remote was its institution accounted in the days of
the great African Father, as well as so entirely forgotten by
that time was its first beginning. I have to shew that in
the Great Oriental Lectionary (whether of the Greek or of
the Syrian Church) the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
Gospel occupy a conspicuous as well as a most honourable
place. And this is easily done: for,
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) The Lesson for Matins <emph>on Ascension-Day</emph> in the
East, in the oldest documents to which we have access, consisted
(as now it does) of <emph>the last Twelve Verses</emph>,&mdash;neither more nor
less,&mdash;of S. Mark's Gospel. At the Liturgy on Ascension was
read S. Luke xxiv. 36-53: but at Matins, S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
The witness of the <q>Synaxaria</q> is constant to this effect.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) The same lection precisely was adopted among the
Syrians by the Melchite Churches,<note place="foot"><q>Lect. fer. quint., quae etiam
Festum Adscensionis Domini in caelos, ad mat. eadem ac lect. tert. Resurrect.; in

(e).</note> In the Evangelistarium used in the Jacobite, (i.e.
the Monophysite) Churches of Syria, a striking difference
of arrangement is discoverable. While S. Luke xxiv. 36-53
was read at Vespers and at Matins on Ascension Day,
<emph>the last seven</emph> verses of S. Mark's Gospel (ch. xvi. 14-20)
were read <emph>at the Liturgy</emph>.<note place="foot">R. Payne Smith's
<hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi> p. 148.</note> Strange, that the self-same Gospel
should have been adopted at a remote age by some of
the Churches of the West,<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Hieronymi Comes</hi>,
(<hi rend='italic'>ed</hi>. Pamel. ii. 31.)&mdash;But it is not the Gallican. (ed.
Mabillon, p. 155.) ... It strikes me as just possible that a clue may be in this
way supplied to the singular phenomenon noted above at p. <ref target="Pg118">118</ref>,
line 22-8.</note> and should survive in our own
Book of Common Prayer to this hour!
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) But S. Mark xvi. 9-20 was not only appointed by the
Greek Church to be read upon Ascension Day. Those same
twelve verses constitute the third of the xi <q><emph>Matin Gospels
of the Resurrection</emph></q> which were universally held in high
<pb n="206"/><anchor id="Pg206"/>
esteem by the Eastern Churches (Greek and Syrian<note place="foot">Εὐαγγέλια ἀναστασιμὰ

R. P. Smith's Catal. p. 127. See by all means, Suicer's <hi rend='italic'>Thes.

were read successively on Sundays at Matins throughout the
year; as well as daily throughout Easter week.

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>e</hi>) Further, these same <q>Twelve Verses</q> constituted the
Lesson at Matins for <emph>the 2nd Sunday after Easter</emph>,&mdash;a Sunday

<emph>Easter-Tuesday</emph>.<note place="foot">Dean Payne Smith's
<hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi> p. 146.</note>
In the Gallican Church, the third lection for

<emph>Easter-Tuesday</emph>, from xvi. 12 to the end of the
Gospel.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ed.</hi> Mabillon, pp. 144-5.</note>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>g</hi>) Lastly, it may be stated that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 was
with the Greeks the Gospel for the Festival of S. Mary

<p>
<emph>He</emph> knows wondrous little about this department of Sacred
Science who can require to be informed that such a weight
of <emph>public</emph> testimony as this to the last Twelve Verses of
a Gospel is simply overwhelming. The single discovery
that in the age of Augustine [385-430] this portion of
S. Mark's Gospel was unquestionably read at Easter in the
Churches of Africa, added to the express testimony of the
Author of the 2nd Homily on the Resurrection, and of the
oldest Syriac MSS., that they were also read by the Orientals
at Easter in the public services of the Church, must be held
to be in a manner decisive of the question.
</p>

<p>
Let the evidence, then, which is borne by Ecclesiastical
usage to the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, be summed
up, and the entire case caused again to pass under review.
</p>

<p>
(1.) That Lessons from the New Testament were publicly
read in the assemblies of the faithful according to a definite
scheme, and on an established system, <emph>at least</emph> as early as the
fourth century,&mdash;has been shewn to be a plain historical
fact. Cyril, at Jerusalem,&mdash;(and by implication, his namesake
at Alexandria,)&mdash;Chrysostom, at Antioch and at Constantinople,&mdash;Augustine,
in Africa,&mdash;all four expressly witness
to the circumstance. In other words, there is found to have
been <emph>at least at that time</emph> fully established throughout the
Churches of Christendom a Lectionary, which seems to have
been essentially one and the same in the West<note place="foot">Note, (in addition to
all that has gone before,) that the Festivals are actually designated by their
<emph>Greek</emph> names in the earliest Latin Service Books: not only <q>Theophania,</q>
<q>Epiphania,</q> <q>Pascha,</q> <q>Pentecostes,</q> (the second, third and fourth of
which appellations survive in the Church of the West, <hi rend='italic'>in memoriam</hi>,
to the present hour;) but <q>Hypapante,</q> which was the title bestowed by the
Orientals in the time of Justinian, on Candlemas Day, (our Feast of the
Purification, or Presentation of <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi> in the Temple,) from
the <q>Meeting</q> of Symeon on that occasion. Friday, or παρασκευή, was called
<q><hi rend='italic'>Parasceve</hi></q> in the West. (Mab. <hi rend='italic'>Lit.
Gall.</hi> p. 129.) So entire was the sympathy of the East with the West in such
matters in very early times, that when Rome decided to celebrate the Nativity on the
25th December, Chrysostom (as we have been reminded) publicly announced the fact at
Constantinople; and it was determined that in this matter East and West would walk by
the same rule.</note> and in the
East. That it must have been of even Apostolic antiquity
may be inferred from several considerations. But that it
dates its beginning from a period <emph>anterior to the age of
<pb n="208"/><anchor id="Pg208"/>
Eusebius,&mdash;which is the age of Codices B and</emph> א,&mdash;at least
admits of <emph>no</emph> controversy.
</p>

<p>
(2.) Next,&mdash;Documents of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century put us in possession of the great Oriental Lectionary as it is found at
that time to have universally prevailed throughout the vast
unchanging East. In other words, several of the actual
Service Books, in Greek and in Syriac,<note place="foot">From Professor Wright's
<hi rend='italic'>Catalogue of Syriac MSS. in the British Museum</hi> (1870) it
appears that the oldest Jacobite Lectionary is dated <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
824; the oldest Nestorian, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 862; the oldest Malkite,
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 1023. The respective numbers of the MSS. are 14,485;
14,492; and 14,488.&mdash;See his <hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>, Part I. pp. 146,
178, 194.</note> have survived the
accidents of full a thousand years: and rubricated copies
of the Gospels carry us back three centuries further. The
entire agreement which is observed to prevail among these
several documents,&mdash;added to the fact that when tested by
the allusions incidentally made by Greek Fathers of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century to what was the Ecclesiastical practice of their own
time, there are found to emerge countless as well as highly
significant notes of correspondence,&mdash;warrants us in believing,
(in the absence of testimony of any sort to the contrary,)
that the Lectionary we speak of differs in no essential
respect from that system of Lections with which
the Church of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century was universally acquainted.
</p>

<p>
Nothing scarcely is more forcibly impressed upon us in
the course of the present inquiry than the fact, that documents
alone are wanting to make <emph>that</emph> altogether demonstrable
which, in default of such evidence, must remain
a matter of inevitable inference only. The forms we are
pursuing at last disappear from our sight: but it is only the
mist of the early morning which shrouds them. We still
hear their voices: still track their footsteps: know that
others still see them, although we ourselves see them no
longer. We are sure that <emph>there they still are</emph>. Moreover they
may yet reappear at any moment. Thus, there exist Syriac
MSS. of the Gospels of the vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> and even of
the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
in which the Lessons are rubricated in the text or on the
margin. A Syriac MS. (of part of the Old T.) is actually
<emph>dated</emph> <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 464.<note place="foot">It is
exhibited in the same glass-case with the Cod. Alexandrinus (A.)</note> Should an
Evangelium of similar date
<pb n="209"/><anchor id="Pg209"/>
ever come to light of which the rubrication was evidently by
the original Scribe, the evidence of the Lectionaries would
at once be carried back full three hundred years.
</p>

<p>
But in fact we stand in need of no such testimony. Acceptable
as it would be, it is plain that it would add no
strength to the argument whatever. We are already able
to plant our footsteps securely in the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
and even in the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century. It is not
enough to insist that inasmuch as the Liturgical method of Christendom was at least fully
established in the East and in the West at the close of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, it therefore must have had its
beginning at a far remoter period. Our two oldest Codices (B and א)
bear witness throughout to the corrupting influence of a system
which was evidently in full operation before the time
of Eusebius. And even this is not all. The readings in
Origen, and of the earliest versions of the Gospel, (the old
Latin, the Syriac, the Egyptian versions,) carry back our
evidence on this subject unmistakably to <emph>the age immediately
succeeding that of the Apostles</emph>. This will be found established
in the course of the ensuing Chapter.
</p>

<p>
Beginning our survey of the problem at the opposite end,
we arrive at the same result; with even a deepened conviction
that in its essential structure, the Lectionary of
the Eastern Church must be of truly primitive antiquity:
indeed that many of its leading provisions must date back
almost,&mdash;nay <emph>quite</emph>,&mdash;to the Apostolic age. From whichever
side we approach this question,&mdash;whatever test we are able
to apply to our premisses,&mdash;our conclusion remains still the
very same.
</p>

<p>
(3.) Into this Lectionary then,&mdash;so universal in its extent,
so consistent in its witness, so Apostolic in its antiquity,&mdash;<q><emph>the</emph>
<hi rend="smallcaps">Last Twelve Verses</hi> <emph>of the Gospel according to
S. Mark</emph></q> from the very first are found to have won for
themselves not only an entrance, a lodgment, an established
place; but, <emph>the place of highest honour</emph>,&mdash;an audience on two
of the Church's chiefest Festivals.
</p>

<p>
The circumstance is far too important, far too significant
to be passed by without a few words of comment.
</p>

<p>
For it is not here, (be it carefully observed,) as when
<pb n="210"/><anchor id="Pg210"/>
we appeal to some Patristic citation, that the recognition of
a phrase, or a verse, or a couple of verses, must be accepted
as a proof that the same ancient Father recognised the
context also in which those words are found. Not so. <emph>All
the Twelve Verses in dispute are found in every known copy</emph>
of the venerable Lectionary of the East. <emph>Those same Twelve
Verses</emph>,&mdash;neither more nor less,&mdash;<emph>are observed to constitute
one integral Lection</emph>.
</p>

<p>
But even this is not all. The most important fact seems
to be that to these Verses has been assigned a place of the
highest possible distinction. It is found that, from the very
first, S. Mark xvi. 9-20 has been everywhere, and by all
branches of the Church Catholic, claimed for <emph>two</emph> of the
Church's greatest Festivals,&mdash;Easter and Ascension. A more
weighty or a more significant circumstance can scarcely be
imagined. To suppose that a portion of Scripture singled
out for such extraordinary honour by the Church universal
is a spurious addition to the Gospel, is purely irrational; is
simply monstrous. No unauthorized <q>fragment,</q> however
<q>remarkable,</q> could by possibility have so established itself
in the regards of the East and of the West, from the very
first. No suspected <q>addition, placed here in very early
times,</q> would have been tolerated in the Church's solemn
public Service six or seven times a-year. No. <emph>It is impossible.</emph>
Had it been one short clause which we were invited
to surrender: a verse: two verses: even three or four:&mdash;the
plea being that (as in the case of the celebrated <hi rend='italic'>pericopa
de adulterâ</hi>) the Lectionaries knew nothing of them:&mdash;the
case would have been entirely different. But for any one
to seek to persuade us that these Twelve Verses, which
exactly constitute one of the Church's most famous Lections,
are every one of them spurious:&mdash;that the fatal taint begins
with the first verse, and only ends with the last:&mdash;<emph>this</emph> is
a demand on our simplicity which, in a less solemn subject,
would only provoke a smile. We are constrained to testify
astonishment and even some measure of concern. Have the
Critics then, (supposing them to be familiar with the evidence
which has now been set forth so much in detail;)&mdash;Have
the Critics then, (we ask) utterly taken leave of their
<pb n="211"/><anchor id="Pg211"/>
senses? or do they really suppose that we have taken leave
of ours?
</p>

<p>
It is time to close this discussion. It was declared at the
outset that the witness of the Lectionaries to the genuineness
of these Verses, though it has been generally overlooked,
is the most important of any: admitting, as it does, of no
evasion: being simply, as it is, decisive. I have now fully
explained the grounds of that assertion. I have set the
Verses, which I undertook to vindicate and establish, on
a basis from which it will be found impossible any more
to dislodge them. Whatever Griesbach, and Tischendorf,
and Tregelles, and the rest, may think about the matter,&mdash;the
Holy Eastern Church in her corporate capacity, has
never been of their opinion. <emph>They</emph> may doubt. <emph>The ante-Nicene
Fathers</emph> at least never doubted. If <q>the last Twelve
Verses</q> of S. Mark were <emph>deservedly</emph> omitted from certain
Copies of his Gospel in the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
utterly incredible is it that these same <hi rend="smallcaps">Twelve Verses</hi>
should have been disseminated, by their authority, throughout Christendom;&mdash;read,
by their command, in all the Churches;&mdash;selected, by
their collective judgment, from the whole body of Scripture
for the special honour of being listened to once and again
at <hi rend="smallcaps">Easter</hi> time, as well as on
<hi rend="smallcaps">Ascension-Day</hi>.

<quote rend="display">
The Text of our five oldest Uncials proved, by an induction of instances,
to have suffered depravation throughout by the operation of
the ancient Lectionary system of the Church (p.
<ref target="Pg217">217</ref>).&mdash;The omission of S. Mark's <q>last Twelve
Verses,</q> (constituting an integral Ecclesiastical Lection,) shewn to be probably
only one more example of the same depraving influence (p. <ref target="Pg224">224</ref>).
This solution of the problem corroborated by the language of Eusebius
and of Hesychius (p. <ref target="Pg232">232</ref>); as well as favoured by the
<q>Western</q> order of the Gospels (p. <ref target="Pg239">239</ref>).
</quote>

<p>
I am much mistaken if the suggestion which I am about
to offer has not already presented itself to every reader of
ordinary intelligence who has taken the trouble to follow
the course of my argument thus far with attention. It requires
no acuteness whatever,&mdash;it is, as it seems to me, the
merest instinct of mother-wit,&mdash;on reaching the present
stage of the discussion, to debate with oneself somewhat as
follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. So then, the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel
were anciently often observed to be missing from the copies.
Eusebius expressly says so. I observe that he nowhere says
that <emph>their genuineness</emph> was anciently <emph>suspected</emph>. As for himself,
his elaborate discussion of their contents convinces me
that individually, he regarded them with favour. The mere
fact,&mdash;(it is best to keep to his actual statement,)&mdash;that
<q>the entire passage</q><note place="foot">The reader is requested to refer back to p.
<ref target="Pg045">45</ref>, and the note there.&mdash;The actual words of Eusebius
are given in <ref target="Appendix_B">Appendix (B)</ref>.</note> was <q>not met with
in all the copies,</q> is the sum of his evidence: and two Greek manuscripts, yet
extant, supposed to be of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century
(Codd. B and א), mutilated in this precise way, testify to the truth of his
statement.
</p>

<p>
2. But then it is found that these self-same Twelve Verses,&mdash;neither
more nor less,&mdash;anciently constituted <emph>an integral
<pb n="213"/><anchor id="Pg213"/>
Ecclesiastical Lection</emph>; which lection,&mdash;inasmuch as it is found
to have established itself in every part of Christendom at
the earliest period to which liturgical evidence reaches back,
and to have been assigned from the very first to two of the
chiefest Church Festivals,&mdash;must needs be a lection of almost
Apostolic antiquity. Eusebius, I observe, (see p. <ref target="Pg045">45</ref>),
designates the portion of Scripture in dispute by its technical
name,&mdash;κεφάλαιον or περικοπή; (for so an Ecclesiastical lection
was anciently called). Here then is a rare coincidence
indeed. It is in fact simply unique. Surely, I may add
that it is in the highest degree suggestive also. It inevitably
provokes the inquiry,&mdash;Must not these two facts be not only
connected, but even <emph>interdependent</emph>? Will not the omission
of the Twelve concluding Verses of S. Mark from certain
ancient copies of his Gospel, have been in some way <emph>occasioned
by the fact</emph> that those same twelve verses constituted an
integral Church Lection? How is it possible to avoid suspecting
that the phenomenon to which Eusebius invites
attention, (viz. that certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel in very
ancient times had been mutilated from the end of the 8th
verse onwards,) ought to be capable of illustration,&mdash;will
have in fact <emph>to be explained</emph>, and in a word <emph>accounted
for</emph>,&mdash;by the circumstance that at the 8th verse of S. Mark's
xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter, one ancient Lection <emph>came
to an end</emph>, and another ancient Lection <emph>began</emph>?
</p>

<p>
Somewhat thus, (I venture to think,) must every unprejudiced
Reader of intelligence hold parley with himself on
reaching the close of the preceding chapter. I need hardly
add that I am thoroughly convinced he would be reasoning
rightly. I am going to shew that the Lectionary practice
of the ancient Church does indeed furnish a sufficient clue
for the unravelment of this now famous problem: in other
words, enables us satisfactorily to account for the omission
of these Twelve Verses from ancient copies of the collected
Gospels. But I mean to do more. I propose to make my
appeal to documents which shall be observed to bear no
faltering witness in my favour. More yet. I propose that
Eusebius himself, the chief author of all this trouble, shall
be brought back into Court and invited to resyllable his
<pb n="214"/><anchor id="Pg214"/>
Evidence; and I am much mistaken if even <emph>he</emph> will not be
observed to let fall a hint that we have at last got on the
right scent;&mdash;have accurately divined how this mistake
took its first beginning;&mdash;and, (what is not least to the
purpose,) have correctly apprehended what was his own real
meaning in what he himself has said.
</p>

<p>
The proposed solution of the difficulty,&mdash;if not the evidence
on which it immediately rests,&mdash;might no doubt be
exhibited within exceedingly narrow limits. Set down
abruptly, however, its weight and value would inevitably
fail to be recognised, even by those who already enjoy some
familiarity with these studies. Very few of the considerations
which I shall have to rehearse are in fact unknown
to Critics: yet is it evident that their bearing on the problem
before us has hitherto altogether escaped their notice.
On the other hand, by one entirely a novice to this department
of sacred Science, I could scarcely hope to be so much
as understood. Let me be allowed, therefore, to preface what
I have to say with a few explanatory details which I promise
shall not be tedious, and which I trust will not be
found altogether without interest either. If they are anywhere
else to be met with, it is my misfortune, not my fault,
that I have been hitherto unsuccessful in discovering the place.
</p>

<p>
I. From the earliest ages of the Church, (as I shewed
at page <ref target="Pg192">192-5</ref>,) it has been customary to read certain
definite portions of Holy Scripture, determined by Ecclesiastical
authority, publicly before the Congregation. In
process of time, as was natural, the sections so required for
public use were collected into separate volumes: Lections
from the Gospels being written out in a Book which was
called <q><hi rend='italic'>Evangelistarium</hi>,</q> (εὐαγγελιστάριον,)&mdash;from
the Acts and Epistles, in a book called <q><hi rend='italic'>Praxapostolus</hi>,</q>
(πραξαπόστολος). These Lectionary-books, both Greek and Syriac,
are yet extant in great numbers,<note place="foot">See the enumeration of Greek
Service-Books in Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. pp. 211-25.
For the Syriac Lectionaries, see Dean Payne Smith's <hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>,
(1864) pp. 114-29-31-4-5-8: also Professor Wright's <hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>,
(1870) pp. 146 to 203.&mdash;I avail myself of this opportunity to thank both those
learned Scholars for their valuable assistance, always most obligingly rendered.</note>
and (I may remark in
<pb n="215"/><anchor id="Pg215"/>
passing) deserve a far greater amount of attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon them.<note place="foot"><q>Evangelistariorum codices literis
uncialibus scripti nondum sic ut decet in usum criticum conversi sunt.</q>
Tischendorf, quoted by Scrivener, [<hi rend='italic'>Introduction to Cod.
Augiensis</hi>,&mdash;80 pages which have been separately published and are
<emph>well</emph> deserving of study,&mdash;p. 48,] who adds,&mdash;<q>I cannot even
conjecture why an Evangelistarium should be thought of less value than another
MS. of the same age.</q>&mdash;See also Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, &amp;c. p. 211.</note>
</p>

<p>
<emph>When</emph> the Lectionary first took the form of a separate
book, has not been ascertained. That no copy is known to
exist (whether in Greek or in Syriac) older than the
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, proves nothing. Codices in daily use, (like the
Bibles used in our Churches,) must of necessity have been
of exceptionally brief duration; and Lectionaries, more even
than Biblical MSS. were liable to injury and decay.
</p>

<p>
II. But it is to be observed,&mdash;(and to explain this, is much
more to my present purpose,)&mdash;that besides transcribing the
Ecclesiastical lections into separate books, it became the
practice at a very early period <emph>to adapt copies of the Gospel
to lectionary purposes</emph>. I suspect that this practice began in
the Churches of Syria; for Syriac copies of the Gospels (<emph>at
least</emph> of the vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century) abound,
which have the Lections more or less systematically rubricated in the
Text.<note place="foot">e.g. <hi rend='italic'>Addit. MSS.</hi> 12,141: 14,449:
14,450-2-4-5-6-7-8: 14,461-3: 17,113-4-5-6:--(= 15 Codd. in all:) from p. 45 to p.
66 of Professor Wright's <hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>.</note> There
is in the British Museum a copy of S. Mark's Gospel according
to the Peshito version, <emph>certainly written previous to
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi></emph> 583, which has at least five or six rubrics so
inserted by the original scribe.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Addit.</hi> MS.
14,464. (See Dr. Wright's <hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>, p. 70.)</note> As a rule,
in all later cursive Greek MSS., (I mean those of the
xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> to the
xv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,) the
Ecclesiastical lections are indicated throughout: while either
at the summit, or else at the foot of the page, the formula
with which the Lection was to be introduced is elaborately
inserted; prefaced probably by a rubricated statement (not
always very easy to decipher) of the occasion <emph>when</emph> the ensuing
portion of Scripture was to be read. The ancients, to
a far greater extent than ourselves,<note place="foot">Add to the eight examples
adduced by Mr. Scrivener from our Book of C. P., (<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
p. 11), the following:&mdash;Gospels for Quinquagesima, 2nd S. after Easter, 9th, 12th,
22nd after Trinity, Whitsunday, Ascension Day, SS. Philip and James (see below, p.
<ref target="Pg220">220</ref>), All Saints.</note> were accustomed,&mdash;(in
<pb n="216"/><anchor id="Pg216"/>
fact, they made it <emph>a rule</emph>,)&mdash;to prefix unauthorized formulæ
to their public Lections; and these are sometimes found
to have established themselves so firmly, that at last they
became as it were ineradicable; and later copyists of the
fourfold Gospel are observed to introduce them unsuspiciously
into the inspired text.<note place="foot">Thus the words εἶπε δὲ ὁ Κύριος (S. Luke
vii. 31) <emph>which introduce an Ecclesiastical Lection</emph> (Friday in the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd </hi> week of S. Luke,) inasmuch as the
words are found in <emph>no</emph> uncial MS., and are omitted besides by the Syriac,
Vulgate, Gothic and Coptic Versions, must needs be regarded as a liturgical
interpolation.&mdash;The same is to be said of ὁ Ἰησοῦς in S. Matth. xiv. 22,&mdash;words
which Origen and Chrysostom, as well as the Syriac versions, omit; and which
clearly owe their place in twelve of the uncials, in the Textus Receptus, in the
Vulgate and some copies of the old Latin, to the fact that the Gospel for the
ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Sunday after Pentecost <emph>begins at that
place</emph>.&mdash;It will be kindred to the present inquiry that I should point out
that in S. Mark xvi. 9, Ἀναστάς ὁ Ἰησοῦς is constantly met with in Greek MSS., and
even in some copies of the Vulgate; and yet there can be <emph>no</emph> doubt that
here also the Holy Name is an interpolation which has originated from the same cause
as the preceding. The fact is singularly illustrated by the insertion of <q>Ο ΙΣ</q>
in Cod. 267 ( = Reg. 69,) <hi rend='italic'>rubro</hi> above <emph>the same
contraction</emph> (for ὁ Ἰησους) in the text.</note> All that belongs to this
subject deserves particular attention; because it is <emph>this</emph> which
explains not a few of the perturbations (so to express oneself)
which the text of the New Testament has experienced.
We are made to understand how, what was originally intended
only as a <emph>liturgical note</emph>, became mistaken, through
the inadvertence or the stupidity of copyists, for a <emph>critical
suggestion</emph>; and thus, besides transpositions without number,
there has arisen, at one time, the insertion of something unauthorized
into the text of Scripture,&mdash;at another, the omission
of certain inspired words, to the manifest detriment of
the sacred deposit. For although the <emph>systematic</emph> rubrication of
the Gospels for liturgical purposes is a comparatively recent
invention,&mdash;(I question if it be older in Greek MSS. than
the x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,)&mdash;yet
will persons engaged in the public Services of <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi>
House have been prone, from the very earliest age, to insert memoranda of the
kind referred to, into the margin of their copies. In this way, in fact, it may
be regarded as certain that in countless minute particulars
<pb n="217"/><anchor id="Pg217"/>
the text of Scripture has been depraved. Let me not fail to
add, that by a judicious, and above all by an <emph>unprejudiced</emph>
use of the materials at our disposal, it may, even at this
distance of time, in every such particular, be successfully
restored.<note place="foot">Not, of course, so long as the present senseless fashion
prevails of regarding Codex B, (to which, if Cod. L. and Codd. 1, 33 and 69 are added,
it is <emph>only because they agree with B</emph>), as an all but infallible guide in
settling the text of Scripture; and quietly taking it for granted that <emph>all the
other MSS. in existence</emph> have entered into a grand conspiracy to deceive
mankind. Until this most uncritical method, this most unphilosophical theory, is
unconditionally abandoned, progress in this department of sacred Science is simply
impossible.</note>
</p>

<p>
III. I now proceed to shew, by an induction of instances,
that <emph>even in the oldest copies in existence</emph>, I mean in Codd. B,
א, A, C, and D, the Lectionary system of the early Church
has left abiding traces of its operation. When a few such
undeniable cases have been adduced, all objections grounded
on <hi rend='italic'>primâ facie</hi> improbability will have been satisfactorily
disposed of. The activity, as well as the existence of such
a disturbing force and depraving influence, <emph>at least</emph> as far
back as the beginning of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, (but
it is in fact more ancient by full two hundred years,) will have been
established: of which I shall only have to shew, in conclusion,
that the omission of <q>the last Twelve Verses</q> of
S. Mark's Gospel is probably but one more instance,&mdash;though
confessedly by far the most extraordinary of any.
</p>

<p>
(1.) From Codex B then, as well as from Cod. A, the two
grand verses which describe our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> <q>Agony and Bloody
Sweat,</q> (S. Luke xxii. 43, 44,) are missing. The same two
verses are absent also from a few other important MSS., as
well as from both the Egyptian versions; but I desire to fasten
attention on the confessedly erring testimony in this place
of Codex B. <q>Confessedly erring,</q> I say; for the genuineness
of those two verses is no longer disputed. Now, in
every known Evangelistarium, the two verses here omitted
by Cod. B follow, (the Church so willed it,) S. Matth. xxvi.
39, and are read as a regular part of the lesson for the
Thursday in Holy Week.<note place="foot">See Matthaei's note on S. Luke xxii. 43,
(<hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test. ed.</hi> 1803.)</note> Of course they are also
<emph>omitted</emph> in the same Evangelistaria from the lesson for the Tuesday
<pb n="218"/><anchor id="Pg218"/>
after Sexagesima, (τῇ γ᾽ τῆς τυροφάγου, as the Easterns call
that day,) when S. Luke xxii. 39-xxiii. 1 used to be read.
Moreover, in all ancient copies of the Gospels which have
been accommodated to ecclesiastical use, <emph>the reader of S. Luke
xxii. is invariably directed by a marginal note to leave out those
two verses</emph>, and to proceed per saltum from ver. 42 to ver.
45.<note place="foot"><p>This will be best understood by actual reference to a
manuscript. In Cod. Evan. 436 (Meerman 117) which lies before me, these directions are
given as follows. After τὸ σὸν γενέσθω (i.e. the last words of ver. 42), is written
ὑπέρβα εἰς τὸ τῆς γ᾽. Then, at the end of ver. 44, is written&mdash;ἄρχου τῆς γ᾽,
after which follows the text καὶ ἀναστὰς, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
In S. Matthew's Gospel, at chap, xxvi, which contains the Liturgical section
for Thursday in Holy Week (τῇ ἁγίᾳ καὶ μεγάλη έ), my Codex has been
only imperfectly rubricated. Let me therefore be allowed to quote from Harl.
MS. 1810, (our Cod. Evan. 113) which, at fol. 84, at the end of S. Matth.
xxvi. 39, reads as follows, immediately after the words,&mdash;αλλ᾽ ὡς
συ:&mdash;Π/Υ, [Cross] (i.e. ὑπάντα.) But in order to explain what is meant, the
above rubricated word and sign are repeated at foot, as follows:&mdash;[Cross]
ὑπάντα εἰς τὸ κατὰ Λουκὰν ἐν κεφαλαίῳ ΡΘ. ὤφθη δὲ αὐτῳ ἄγγελος: εἶτα στραφεὶς ἐνταῦθα
πάλιν, λέγε: καὶ ἔρχεται πρὸς τοὺς μαθητάς&mdash;which are the first words of S.
Matth. xxvi. 40.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, my Codex (No. 436, above referred to) immediately after
S. Luke xxii. 42, <emph>besides</emph> the rubric already quoted, has the following:
ἄρξου τῆς μεγάλης έ. Then come the two famous verses (ver. 43, 44); and, after the
words ἀναστὰς ἀπὸ τῆς προσευχῆς, the following rubric occurs: ὑπάντα εἰς τὸ
τῆς μεγάλης έ Ματθ. ἔρχεται πρὸς τοῦς μαθητάς.
</p>
<p>
[With the help of my nephew, (Rev. W. F. Rose, Curate of Holy Trinity,
Windsor,) I have collated every syllable of Cod. 436. Its text most nearly
resembles the Rev. F. H. Scrivener's l, m, n.]
</p></note>
What more obvious therefore than that the removal of the
paragraph from its proper place in S. Luke's Gospel is to be
attributed to nothing else but the Lectionary practice of the
primitive Church? Quite unreasonable is it to impute heretical
motives, or to invent any other unsupported theory,
while this plain solution of the difficulty is at hand.
</p>

<p>
(2.) The same Cod. B., (with which Codd. א, C, L, U and Γ
are observed here to conspire,) introduces the piercing of the
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> side (S. John xix. 34) at the end of S. Matth.
xxvii. 49. Now, I only do not insist that this must needs
be the result of the singular Lectionary practice already described
at p. 202, because a scholion in Cod. 72 records the
singular fact that in the Diatessaron of Tatian, after S. Matth.
xxvii. 48, was read ἄλλος δὲ λαβὼν λόγχην ἔνυξεν αὐτοῦ τὴν
<pb n="219"/><anchor id="Pg219"/>
πλευρὰν: καὶ ἐξῆλθεν ὕδωρ καὶ αἷμα. (Chrysostom's codex was
evidently vitiated in <emph>precisely</emph> the same way.) This interpolation
therefore may have resulted from the corrupting influence
of Tatian's (so-called) <q>Harmony.</q> See <ref target="Appendix_H">Appendix (H)</ref>.
</p>

<p>
(3.) To keep on safe ground. Codd. B and D concur in what
Alford justly calls the <q>grave error</q> of simply omitting
from S. Luke xxiii. 34, our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> supplication on behalf of
His murderers, (ὁ δὲ Ἰησοῦς ἔλεγε, Πάτερ, ἄφες αὐτοῖς: οὐ
γὰρ οἴδασι τί ποιοῦσι). They are not quite singular in so
doing; being, as usual, kept in countenance by certain
copies of the old Latin, as well as by both the Egyptian
versions. How is this <q>grave error</q> in so many ancient
MSS. to be accounted for? (for a <q>grave error</q> or rather
<q>a fatal omission</q> it certainly is). Simply by the fact that
in the Eastern Church the Lection for the Thursday after
Sexagesima <emph>breaks off abruptly, immediately before these very
words</emph>,&mdash;to recommence at ver. 44.<note place="foot">See by all means
Matthaei's <hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (ed. 1803,) i. p.491, and 492.</note>
</p>

<p>
(4.) Note, that at ver. 32, <emph>the eighth <q>Gospel of the Passion</q>
begins</emph>,&mdash;which is the reason why Codd. B and א (with
the Egyptian versions) exhibit a singular irregularity in
that place; and why the Jerusalem Syriac introduces the
established formula of the Lectionaries (σὺν τῷ Ἰησοῦ) at
the same juncture.
</p>

<p>
(If I do not here insist that the absence of the famous
<hi rend='italic'>pericopa de adulterâ</hi> (S. John vii. 53-viii. 11,) from so
many MSS., is to be explained in precisely the same way, it
is only because the genuineness of that portion of the Gospel
is generally denied; and I propose, in this enumeration
of instances, not to set foot on disputed ground. I am convinced,
nevertheless, that the first occasion of the omission
of those memorable verses was the lectionary practice of the
primitive Church, which, on Whitsunday, read from S. John
vii. 37 to viii. 12, <emph>leaving out the twelve verses</emph> in question.
Those verses, from the nature of their contents, (as Augustine
declares,) easily came to be viewed with dislike or suspicion.
The passage, however, is as old as the second century,
for it is found in certain copies of the old Latin. Moreover
Jerome deliberately gave it a place in the Vulgate. I pass on.)
</p>

<pb n="220"/><anchor id="Pg220"/>

<p>
(5.) The two oldest Codices in existence,&mdash;B and א,&mdash;stand
all but alone in omitting from S. Luke vi. 1 the unique
and indubitably genuine word δευτεροπρώτῳ; which is also
omitted by the Peshito, Italic and Coptic versions. And
yet, when it is observed that an <emph>Ecclesiastical lection begins
here</emph>, and that the Evangelistaria (which <emph>invariably</emph> leave out
such notes of time) simply drop the word,&mdash;only substituting
for ἐν σαββάτῳ the more familiar τοῖς σάββασι,&mdash;every one
will be ready to admit that if the omission of this word be
not due to the inattention of the copyist, (which, however,
seems to me not at all unlikely,<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg075">75</ref>, note (h).</note>) it is sufficiently explained
by the Lectionary practice of the Church,&mdash;which may well
date back even to the immediately post-Apostolic age.
</p>

<p>
(6.) In S. Luke xvi. 19, Cod. D introduces the Parable of
Lazarus with the formula,&mdash;εἶπεν δὲ καὶ ἑτέραν παραβολήν;
which is nothing else but a marginal note which has found
its way into the text from the margin; being <emph>the liturgical
introduction of a Church-lesson</emph><note place="foot">For the 5th Sunday of S.
Luke.</note> which afterwards began εἶπεν ὁ Κύριος τὴν παραβολὴν
ταύτην.<note place="foot">Such variations are quite common. Matthaei, with his usual
accuracy, points out several: e.g. <hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (1788) vol. i.
p. 19 (<hi rend='italic'>note</hi> 26), p. 23: vol. ii. p. 10
(<hi rend='italic'>note</hi> 12), p. 14 (<hi rend='italic'>notes</hi> 14 and 15),
&amp;c.</note>
</p>

<p>
(7.) In like manner, the same Codex makes S. John xiv.
begin with <emph>the liturgical formula</emph>,&mdash;(it survives in our Book of
Common Prayer<note place="foot">SS. Philip and James.</note> to this very
hour!)&mdash;καὶ εἶπεν τοῖς μαθήταις αὐτοῦ: in which it is countenanced by certain MSS.
of the Vulgate and of the old Latin Version. Indeed, it may be
stated generally concerning the text of Cod. D, that it bears
marks <emph>throughout</emph> of the depraving influence of the ancient
Lectionary practice. Instances of this, (in addition to those
elsewhere cited in these pages,) will be discovered in S. Luke
iii. 23: iv. 16 (and xix. 45): v. 1 and 17: vi. 37 (and xviii.
15): vii. 1: x. 1 and 25: xx. 1: in all but three of which,
Cod. D is kept in countenance by the old Latin, often by the
Syriac, and by other versions of the greatest antiquity. But
to proceed.
</p>

<p>
(8.) Cod. A, (supported by Athanasius, the Vulgate,
Gothic, and Philoxenian versions,) for καί, in S. Luke ix. 57,
<pb n="221"/><anchor id="Pg221"/>
reads ἐγένετο δὲ,&mdash;which is the reading of the Textus Receptus.
Cod. D, (with some copies of the old Latin,) exhibits
καὶ ἐγένετο. All the diversity which is observable in this
place, (and it is considerable,) is owing to the fact that
<emph>an Ecclesiastical lection begins here</emph>.<note place="foot">viz. σαββάτῳ θ:
i.e. the ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Saturday in S. Luke.&mdash;Note
that Cod. A also reads ἐγένετο δέ in S. Lu. xi. 1.</note> In different Churches,
the formula with which the lection was introduced slightly
differed.
</p>

<p>
(9.) Cod. C is supported by Chrysostom and Jerome, as
well as by the Peshito, Cureton's and the Philoxenian Syriac,
and some MSS. of the old Latin, in reading ὁ Ἰησοῦς at the
beginning of S. Matth. xi. 20. That the words have no business
there, is universally admitted. So also is the cause of
their interpolation generally recognized. <emph>The Ecclesiastical
lection</emph> for Wednesday in the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
week after Pentecost <emph>begins at that place</emph>; and begins with the
formula,&mdash;ἐν τῷ καίρῳ ἐκεινῳ, ἤρξατο ὁ Ἰησοῦς ὀνειδίζειν.
</p>

<p>
(10.) Similarly, in S. Matth. xii. 9, xiii. 36, and xiv. 14,
Cod. C inserts ὁ Ἰησοῦς; a reading which on all three occasions
is countenanced by the Syriac and some copies of the
old Latin, and on the last of the three, by Origen also. And
yet there can be no doubt that it is only because <emph>Ecclesiastical
lections begin at those places</emph>,<note place="foot">viz. Monday in the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, Thursday in the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> week after Pentecost, and
the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Sunday after Pentecost.</note>
that the Holy Name is introduced there.
</p>

<p>
(11.) Let me add that the Sacred Name is confessedly an
interpolation in the six places indicated at foot,&mdash;its presence
being accounted for by the fact that, in each, an <emph>Ecclesiastical
lection begins</emph>.<note place="foot">viz. S. Luke xiii. 2: xxiv. 36. S. John i.
29 (ὁ Ἰωάννης): 44: vi. 14: xiii. 3,&mdash;to which should perhaps be added xxi. 1,
where B, א, A, C (not D) read Ἰησοῦς.</note> Cod. D in one of these places, Cod. A in
four, is kept in countenance by the old Latin, the Syriac, the
Coptic and other early versions;&mdash;convincing indications of
the extent to which the Lectionary practice of the Church
had established itself so early as the second century of
our æra.
</p>

<p>
Cod. D, and copies of the old Latin and Egyptian versions
also read τοῦ Ἰησοῦ, (instead of αὐτοῦ,) in S. Mark
xiv. 3; which is only because <emph>a Church lesson begins there</emph>.
</p>

<pb n="222"/><anchor id="Pg222"/>

<p>
(12.) The same Cod. D is all but unique in leaving out
that memorable verse in S. Luke's Gospel (xxiv. 12), in
which S. Peter's visit to the Sepulchre of our risen <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>
finds particular mention. It is only because that verse was
claimed both as the <emph>conclusion</emph> of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> and also as the
<emph>beginning</emph> of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
Gospel of the Resurrection: so that the
liturgical note ἀρχή stands at the beginning,&mdash;τέλος at the
end of it. Accordingly, D is kept in countenance here only
by the Jerusalem Lectionary and some copies of the old
Latin. But what is to be thought of the editorial judgment
which (with Tregelles) encloses this verse within brackets;
and (with Tischendorf) <emph>rejects it from the text altogether</emph>?
</p>

<p>
(13.) Codices B, א, and D are <emph>alone</emph> among MSS. in omitting
the clause διελθὼν διὰ μέσου αὐτῶν: καὶ παρῆγεν οὔτως,
at the end of the 59th verse of S. John viii. The omission
is to be accounted for by the fact that just <emph>there</emph> the Church-lesson
for Tuesday in the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> week after Easter
<emph>came to an end</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(14.) Again. It is not at all an unusual thing to find
in cursive MSS., at the end of S. Matth. viii. 13, (with several
varieties), the spurious and tasteless appendix,&mdash;καὶ
ὑποστρέψας ὁ ἑκατόνταρχος εἰς τὸν οἶκον αὐτοῦ ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ
ὤρᾳ εὗρεν τὸν παῖδα ὑγιαίνοντα: a clause which owes its
existence solely to the practice of ending the lection for the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Sunday after Pentecost in
that unauthorized manner.<note place="foot">See by all means Matthaei's interesting
note on the place,&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (1788) vol. i. p. 113-4.
It should be mentioned that Cod. C (and four other uncials), together with the
Philoxenian and Hierosolymitan versions, concur in exhibiting the same spurious
clause. Matthaei remarks,&mdash;<q>Origenes (iv. 171 <hi rend="smallcaps">d</hi>)
hanc pericopam haud adeo diligenter recensens terminat eum in γενηθήτω σοι.</q>
Will not the disturbing <emph>Lectionary-practice</emph> of his day sufficiently
explain Origen's omission?</note>
But it is not only in cursive MSS. that these words are
found. <emph>They are met with also in the Codex Sinaiticus</emph> (א):
a witness at once to the inveteracy of Liturgical usage in
the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century of our æra,
and to the corruptions which the <q>Codex omnium antiquissimus</q>
will no doubt have inherited from a yet older copy than itself.
</p>

<pb n="223"/><anchor id="Pg223"/>

<p>
(15.) In conclusion, I may remark generally that there
occur instances, again and again, of perturbations of the
Text in our oldest MSS., (corresponding sometimes with
readings vouched for by the most ancient of the Fathers,)
which admit of no more intelligible or inoffensive solution
than by referring them to the Lectionary practice of the
primitive Church.<note place="foot">I recall S. John x. 29: xix. 13: xxi. 1;&mdash;but
the attentive student will be able to multiply such references almost indefinitely. In
these and similar places, while the phraseology is exceedingly simple, the variations
which the text exhibits are so exceeding numerous,&mdash;that when it is discovered that
<emph>a Church Lesson begins in those places</emph>, we may be sure that we have been put
in possession of the name of the disturbing force.</note>
</p>

<p>
Thus when instead of καὶ ἀναβαίνω ὁ Ἰησοῦς εἰς Ἱεροσόλυμα
(S. Matth. xx. 17), Cod. B reads, (and, is almost
unique in reading,) Μέλλων δὲ ἀναβαίνειν ὁ Ἰησοῦς; and
when Origen sometimes quotes the place in the same way,
but sometimes is observed to transpose the position of the
Holy Name in the sentence; when again six of Matthaei's
MSS., (and Origen once,) are observed to put the same
Name <emph>after</emph> Ἱεροσόλυμα: when, lastly, two of Field's
MSS.,<note place="foot">Viz. K and M. (Field's <hi rend='italic'>Chrys.</hi> p.
251.)&mdash;How is it that the readings of Chrysostom are made so little account of?
By Tregelles, for example, why are they overlooked entirely?</note> and one of
Matthaei's, (and I dare say a great many more, if the truth were known,) omit the words
ὁ Ἰησοῦς entirely:&mdash;<emph>who</emph> sees not that the true disturbing force in
this place, from the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> century of our æra
downwards, has been <emph>the Lectionary practice of the primitive
Church</emph>?&mdash;the fact that <emph>there</emph> the lection for the Thursday
after the viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
Sunday after Pentecost began?&mdash;And this may suffice.
</p>

<p>
IV. It has been proved then, in what goes before, more
effectually even than in a preceding page,<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg197">197</ref> to 204.</note> not only that
Ecclesiastical Lections corresponding with those indicated
in the <q>Synaxaria</q> were fully established in the immediately
post-Apostolic age, but also that at that early period
the Lectionary system of primitive Christendom had already
exercised a depraving influence of a peculiar kind on the
text of Scripture. Further yet, (and <emph>this</emph> is the only point
I am now concerned to establish), that <hi rend='italic'>our five oldest Copies
of the Gospels</hi>,&mdash;B and א as well as A, C and D,&mdash;exhibit
<pb n="224"/><anchor id="Pg224"/>
not a few traces of the mischievous agency alluded to;
errors, and especially <emph>omissions</emph>, which sometimes seriously
affect the character of those Codices as witnesses to the
Truth of Scripture.&mdash;I proceed now to consider the case of
S. Mark xvi. 9-20; only prefacing my remarks with a few
necessary words of explanation.
</p>

<p>
V. He who takes into his hands an ordinary cursive MS.
of the Gospels, is prepared to find the Church-lessons regularly
indicated throughout, in the text or in the margin.
</p>

<p>
A familiar contraction, executed probably in vermillion [χ over αρ],
ἀρ, indicates the <q>beginning</q> (ἀρχή) of each lection: a corresponding
contraction (ε over τ, τε, τελ), indicates its <q>end</q>
(τέλοσ.) Generally, these rubrical directions, (for they are
nothing else,) are inserted for convenience into the body of
the text,&mdash;from which the red pigment with which they are
almost invariably executed, effectually distinguishes them.
But all these particulars gradually disappear as recourse is
had to older and yet older MSS. The studious in such
matters have noticed that even the memorandums as to the
<q>beginning</q> and the <q>end</q> of a lection are rare, almost
in proportion to the antiquity of a Codex. When they do
occur in the later uncials, they do not by any means always
seem to have been the work of the original scribe; neither
has care been always taken to indicate them in ink of
a different colour. It will further be observed in such MSS.
that whereas the sign where the reader is to begin is generally&mdash;(in
order the better to attract his attention,)&mdash;inserted
in <emph>the margin</emph> of the Codex, the note where he is to
leave off, (in order the more effectually to arrest his progress,)
is as a rule introduced <emph>into the body of the text</emph>.<note place="foot">e.g.
in Cod. Evan. 10 and 270.</note> In
uncial MSS., however, all such symbols are not only rare,
but (what is much to be noted) they are exceedingly irregular
in their occurrence. Thus in Codex Γ, in the Bodleian
Library, (a recently acquired uncial MS. of the Gospels,
written <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 844), there occurs no indication of the
<q>end</q> of a single lection in S. Luke's Gospel, until chap.
<pb n="225"/><anchor id="Pg225"/>
xvi. 31 is reached; after which, the sign abounds. In Codex
L, the original notes of Ecclesiastical Lections occur at the
following rare and irregular intervals:&mdash;S. Mark ix. 2:
x. 46: xii. 40 (where the sign has lost its way; it should
have stood against ver. 44): xv. 42 and xvi. 1.<note place="foot">In some cursive MSS.
also, (which have been probably transcribed from ancient originals), the same
phenomenon is observed. Thus, in Evan. 265 ( = Reg. 66), ΤΕΛ only occurs, in S. Mark,
at ix. 9 and 41: xv. 32 and 41: xvi. 8. ΑΡΧ at xvi. 1. It is striking to observe that
so little were these ecclesiastical notes (embedded in the text) understood by the
possessor of the MS., that in the margin, over against ch. xv. 41, (where
<q>ΤΕΛ:</q> stands <emph>in the text</emph>,) a somewhat later hand has
written,&mdash;ΤΕ[λος] Τ[ης] ΩΡ[ας]. A similar liturgical note may be seen over
against ch. ix. 9, and elsewhere. Cod. 25 (= Reg. 191), at the end of S. Mark's
Gospel, has <emph>only two</emph> notes of liturgical
endings: viz. at ch. xv. 1 and 42.</note> In the
<emph>oldest</emph> uncials, nothing of the kind is discoverable. Even in
the Codex Bezæ, (vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,) not
a single liturgical direction <emph>coeval with the MS.</emph> is anywhere to be found.
</p>

<p>
VI. And yet, although the practice of thus indicating the
beginning and the end of a liturgical section, does not seem
to have come into general use until about the
xii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century;
and although, previous to the ix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, systematic liturgical directions are probably unknown;<note place="foot">Among
the <emph>Syriac</emph> Evangelia, as explained above (p. <ref target="Pg215">215</ref>),
instances occur of far more ancient MSS. which exhibit a text rubricated by the original
scribe. Even here, however, (as may be learned from Dr. Wright's
<hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>, pp. 46-66,) such Rubrics have been only
<emph>irregularly</emph> inserted in the oldest copies.</note> the <emph>need</emph>
of them must have been experienced by one standing up to read before
the congregation, long before. The want of some reminder
where he was to begin,&mdash;above all, of some hint
where he was to leave off,&mdash;will have infallibly made itself
felt from the first. Accordingly, there are not wanting indications
that, occasionally, ΤΕΛΟΣ (or ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ) was written
in the margin of Copies of the Gospels at an exceedingly
remote epoch. One memorable example of this practice is
supplied by the Codex Bezæ (D): where in S. Mark xiv. 41,
instead of ἀπέχει ἦλθεν ἡ ὤρα,&mdash;we meet with the unintelligible
ΑΠΕΧΕΙ ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ ΚΑΙ Η ΩΡΑ. Now, nothing
else has here happened but that a marginal note, designed
originally to indicate the end (ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ) of the lesson for
<pb n="226"/><anchor id="Pg226"/>
the third day of the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> week
of the Carnival, has lost its way from the end of ver. 42, and got thrust into the text
of ver. 41,&mdash;to the manifest destruction of the sense.<note place="foot"><p>Note,
that the Codex from which Cod. D was copied will have exhibited
the text thus,&mdash;ΑΠΕΧΕΙ ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ ΗΛΘΕΝ Η ΩΡΑ.&mdash;which is the reading
of Cod. 13 ( = Reg. 50.) But the scribe of Cod. D, in order to improve
the sense, substituted for ἦλθεν the word καί. Note the scholion [<hi rend='italic'>Anon.
Vat.</hi>] in Possinus, p. 321:&mdash;ἀπέχει, τουτέστι, πεπλήρωται, τέλος ἔχει τὸ
κατ᾽ ἐμέ.
</p>
<p>
Besides the said Cod. 13, the same reading is found in 47 and 54 (in the
Bodl.): 56 (at Linc. Coll.): 61 (i.e. Cod. Montfort.): 69 (i.e. Cod. Leicestr.):
124 (i.e. Cod. Vind. Lamb. 31): c<hi rend="vertical-align: super">secr</hi>
(i.e. Lambeth, 1177): 2<hi rend="vertical-align: super">pe</hi> (i.e. the 2nd
of Muralt's S. Petersburg Codd.); and Cod. 439 (i.e. Addit. Brit. Mus. 5107).
All these eleven MSS. read ἀπέχει τὸ τέλος at S. Mark xiv. 41.
</p></note> I find D's error here is shared (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) by
the Peshito Syriac, (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) by the old Latin,
and (<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) by the Philoxenian: venerable partners
in error, truly! for the first two probably carry back
this false reading to <emph>the second century of our æra</emph>; and so,
furnish one more remarkable proof, to be added to the fifteen
(or rather the forty) already enumerated (pp. <ref target="Pg217">217-23</ref>), that
the lessons of the Eastern Church were settled at a period long
anterior to the date of the oldest MS. of the Gospels extant.
</p>

<p>
VII. Returning then to the problem before us, I venture
to suggest as follows:&mdash;What if, at a very remote period,
this same isolated liturgical note (ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ) occurring at
S. Mark xvi. 8, (which <emph>is</emph> <q>the end</q> of <emph>the Church-lection</emph>
for the ii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> Sunday after Easter,) should have
unhappily suggested to some copyist,&mdash;καλλιγραφίας <hi rend='italic'>quam vel
Criticæ Sacræ vel rerum Liturgicarum peritior</hi>,&mdash;the notion that the
entire <q><emph>Gospel according to S. Mark</emph>,</q> came to an end at
verse 8?... I see no more probable account of the matter,
I say, than this:&mdash;That the mutilation of the last chapter
of S. Mark has resulted from the fact, that some very ancient
scribe <emph>misapprehended the import of the solitary liturgical note</emph>
ΤΕΛΟΣ (or ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ) which he found at the close of verse 8.
True, that he will have probably beheld, further on, several
additional στίχοι. But if he did, how could he acknowledge
the fact more loyally than by leaving (as the author
of Cod. B is observed to have done) one entire column blank,
before proceeding with S. Luke? He hesitated, all the same,
<pb n="227"/><anchor id="Pg227"/>
<emph>to transcribe</emph> any further, having before him, (as he thought,)
an assurance that <q><hi rend="smallcaps">the end</hi></q> had been reached at ver. 8.
</p>

<p>
VIII. That some were found in very early times eagerly
to acquiesce in this omission: to sanction it: even to multiply
copies of the Gospel so mutilated; (critics or commentators
intent on nothing so much as reconciling the apparent
discrepancies in the Evangelical narratives:)&mdash;appears to
me not at all unlikely.<note place="foot">So Scholz (i. 200):&mdash;<q>Pericopa hæc
<emph>casu quodam</emph> forsan exciderat a codice
quodam Alexandrino; unde defectus iste in alios libros transiit. Nec mirum
hunc defectum multis, immo in certis regionibus plerisque scribis arrisisse:
confitentur enim ex ipsorum opinione Marcum Matthæo repugnare. Cf.
maxima Eusebium ad Marinum,</q> &amp;c.</note> Eusebius almost says as much, when
he puts into the mouth of one who is for getting rid of
these verses altogether, the remark that <q>they would be in
a manner superfluous <emph>if it should appear that their testimony
is at variance with that of the other Evangelists</emph>.</q><note place="foot">περιττὰ
ὰν εἴη, καὶ μάλιστα εἴπερ ἔχοιεν ἀντιλογίαν τῇ τῶν λοιπῶν εὐαγγελιστῶν
μαρτυρίᾳ. (Mai, <hi rend='italic'>Bibl. P.P. Nova</hi>, vol. iv. p. 256.)</note> (The
ancients were giants in Divinity but children in Criticism.) On the
other hand, I altogether agree with Dean Alford in thinking
it highly improbable that the difficulty of harmonizing one
Gospel with another in this place, (such as it is,) was the
cause why these Twelve Verses were originally suppressed.<note place="foot">Alford's
N.T. vol. i. p. 433, (<hi rend='italic'>ed</hi>. 1868.)&mdash;And so Tischendorf,
(ed. 8va. pp. 406-7.) <q>Talem dissentionem ad Marci librum tam misere mutilandum
adduxisse quempiam, et quidem tanto cum successu, prorsus incredibile est, nec
ullo probari potest exemplo.</q>&mdash;Tregelles is of the same opinion.
(<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, pp. 255-6.)&mdash;Matthaei, a competent judge,
seems to have thought differently. <q>Una autem causa cur hic locus omitteretur fuit
quod Marcus in his repugnare ceteris videtur Evangelistis.</q> The general observation
which follows is true enough:&mdash;<q>Quæ ergo vel obscura, vel repugnantia, vel parum
decora quorundam opinione habebantur, ca olim ab Criticis et interpretibus
nonnullis vel sublata, vel in dubium vocata esse, ex aliis locis sanctorum
Evangeliorum intelligitur.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> 1788, vol. ii. p.
266.) Presently, (at p. 270,)&mdash;<q>In summâ. Videtur unus et item alter ex
interpretibus, qui hæc cæteris evangeliis repugnare opinebatur, in dubium vocasse.
Hunc deinde plures temere secuti sunt, ut plerumque factum esse animadvertimus.</q> Dr.
Davidson says the same thing (ii. 116.) and, (what is of vastly more importance,)
Mr. Scrivener also. (<hi rend='italic'>Coll. Cod. Sin.</hi> p. xliv.)</note>
(1) First, because there really was no need to withhold more
than three,&mdash;at the utmost, five of them,&mdash;if <emph>this</emph> had been
the reason of the omission. (2) Next, because it would have
<pb n="228"/><anchor id="Pg228"/>
been easier far to introduce some critical correction of any
supposed discrepancy, than to sweep away the whole of the
unoffending context. (3) Lastly, because nothing clearly
was gained by causing the Gospel to end so abruptly that
every one must see at a glance that it had been mutilated.
No. The omission having originated in a mistake, was perpetuated
for a brief period (let us suppose) only through
infirmity of judgment: or, (as I prefer to believe), only in
consequence of the religious fidelity of copyists, who were
evidently always instructed to transcribe exactly what they
found in the copy set before them. The Church meanwhile
in her corporate capacity, has never known anything at all
of the matter,&mdash;as was fully shewn above in <ref target="Chapter_X">Chap. X.</ref>
</p>

<p>
IX. When this solution of the problem first occurred to
me, (and it occurred to me long before I was aware of the
memorable reading ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ in the Codex Bezæ, already
adverted to,) I reasoned with myself as follows:&mdash;But if the
mutilation of the second Gospel came about in this particular
way, the MSS. are bound to remember <emph>something</emph> of the
circumstance; and in ancient MSS., if I am right, I ought
certainly to meet with <emph>some</emph> confirmation of my opinion.
According to my view, at the root of this whole matter lies
the fact that at S. Mark xvi. 8 a well-known Ecclesiastical
lesson comes to an end. Is there not perhaps something
exceptional in the way that the close of that liturgical
section was anciently signified?
</p>

<p>
X. In order to ascertain this, I proceeded to inspect every
copy of the Gospels in the Imperial Library at Paris;<note place="foot">I have to
acknowledge very gratefully the obliging attentions of M. de
Wailly, the chief of the Manuscript department.</note> and
devoted seventy hours exactly, with unflagging delight, to
the task. The success of the experiment astonished me.
</p>

<p>
1. I began with <emph>our</emph> Cod. 24 ( = Reg. 178) of the Gospels:
turned to the last page of S. Mark: and beheld, in a Codex
of the xi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Century wholly
devoid of the Lectionary apparatus
which is sometimes found in MSS. of a similar
date,<note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg224">224</ref>.</note>
at fol. 104, the word + ΤΕΛΟΣ + conspicuously written
by the original scribe immediately after S. Mark xvi. 8, as
<pb n="229"/><anchor id="Pg229"/>
well as at the close of the Gospel. <emph>It occurred besides only
at ch.</emph> ix. 9, (the end of the lesson for the Transfiguration.)
And yet there are <emph>at least seventy</emph> occasions in the course
of S. Mark's Gospel where, in MSS. which have been accommodated
to Church use, it is usual to indicate the close
of a Lection. This discovery, which surprised me not a little,
convinced me that I was on the right scent; and every hour
I met with some fresh confirmation of the fact.
</p>

<p>
2. For the intelligent reader will readily understand that
three such deliberate liturgical memoranda, occurring solitary
in a MS. of this date, are to be accounted for only in
one way. They infallibly represent a corresponding peculiarity
in some far more ancient document. The fact that
the word ΤΕΛΟΣ is here (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) set down unabbreviated,
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) in black ink, and (<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>)
as part of the text,&mdash;points unmistakably
in the same direction. But that Cod. 24 is derived from
a Codex of much older date is rendered certain by a circumstance
which shall be specified at foot.<note place="foot">Whereas in the course of S.
Matthew's Gospel, only two examples of + ΤΕΛΟΣ + occur, (viz. at ch. xxvi. 35 and
xxvii. 2,)&mdash;in the former case the note has entirely lost its way in the process
of transcription; standing where it has no business to appear. <emph>No</emph>
Liturgical section ends thereabouts. I suspect that the transition (ὑπέρβασις)
anciently made at ver. 39, was the thing to which the scribe desired to call
attention.</note>
</p>

<p>
3. The very same phenomena reappear in Cod. 36.<note place="foot">= Coisl. 20. This
sumptuous MS., which has not been adapted for
Church purposes, appears to me to be the work of the same scribe who produced
Reg. 178, (the codex described above); but it exhibits a different text.
Bound up with it are some leaves of the LXX of about the
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century.</note> The
sign + ΤΕΛΟΣ +, (which occurs punctually at S. Mark xvi. 8
and again at v. 20,) is found besides in S. Mark's Gospel
only at chap. i. 8;<note place="foot">End of the Lection for the Sunday before
Epiphany.</note> at chap. xiv. 31; and (+ ΤΕΛΟΣ ΤΟΥ
ΚΕΦΑΛ) at chap. xv. 24;&mdash;being on every occasion incorporated
with the Text. Now, when it is perceived that in
the second and third of these places, ΤΕΛΟΣ has clearly lost
its way,&mdash;appearing where <emph>no</emph> Ecclesiastical lection came to
an end,&mdash;it will be felt that the MS. before us (of the
xi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century) if it was not actually
transcribed from,&mdash;must at least exhibit at second hand,&mdash;a far
more ancient Codex.<note place="foot">In S. Matthew's Gospel, I could find ΤΕΛΟΣ
so written only twice,&mdash;viz. at ch. ii. 23 and xxvi. 75: in S. Luke only
once,&mdash;viz. at ch. viii. 39. These, in all three instances, are the
concluding verses of famous Lessons,&mdash;viz. the Sunday after Christmas Day,
the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> Gospel of the Passion, the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Sunday
of S. Luke.</note>
</p>

<pb n="230"/><anchor id="Pg230"/>

<p>
4. Only once more.&mdash;Codex 22 ( = Reg. 72) was never
prepared for Church purposes. A rough hand has indeed
scrawled indications of the beginnings and endings of a few
of the Lessons, here and there; but these liturgical notes
are no part of the original MS. At S. Mark xvi. 8, however,
we are presented (as before) with the solitary note
+ ΤΕΛΟΣ +&mdash;, incorporated with the text. Immediately after
which, (in writing of the same size,) comes a memorable
statement<note place="foot">This has already come before us in a different
connection: (see p. <ref target="Pg119">119</ref>): but it must needs be reproduced
here; and <emph>this</emph> time, it shall be exhibited as
faithfully as my notes permit.</note> in red letters. The whole stands thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ΦΟΒΟΥΝΤΟ ΓΑΡ + ΤΕΛΟΣ +&mdash;<lb/>
[cross] ΕΝ ΤΙΣΙ ΤΩΝ ΑΝΤΙΓΡΑΦΩΝ.<lb/>
ΕΩΣ ΩΔΕ ΠΛΗΡΟΥΤΑΙ Ο ΕΥ<lb/>
ΑΓΓΕΛΙΣΤΗΣ: ΕΝ ΠΟΛΛΟΙΣ<lb/>
ΔΕ. ΚΑΙ ΤΑΥΤΑ ΦΕΡΕΤΑΙ +&mdash;<lb/>
ΑΝΑΣΤΑΣ ΔΕ. ΠΡΟΙ ΠΡΩΤΗ ΣΑΒΒΑΤΩΝ.
</p>

<p>
And then follows the rest of the Gospel; at the end of
which, the sign + ΤΕΛΟΣ + is again repeated,&mdash;which sign,
however, occurs <emph>nowhere else</emph> in the MS. <emph>nor at the end of any of
the other three Gospels</emph>. A more opportune piece of evidence
could hardly have been invented. A statement so apt and
so significant was surely a thing rather to be wished than
to be hoped for. For here is the liturgical sign ΤΕΛΟΣ not
only occurring in the wholly exceptional way of which we
have already seen examples, but actually followed by the
admission that <q>In certain copies, <emph>the Evangelist proceeds no
further</emph>.</q> The two circumstances so brought together seem
exactly to bridge over the chasm between Codd. B and א on
the one hand,&mdash;and Codd. 24 and 36 on the other; and to
supply us with precisely the link of evidence which we require.
For observe:&mdash;During the first six centuries of our
æra, no single instance is known of a codex in which ΤΕΛΟΣ
is written at the end of a Gospel. The subscription of
<pb n="231"/><anchor id="Pg231"/>
S. Mark for instance is <emph>invariably</emph> either ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ,&mdash;(as
in B and א): or else ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ,&mdash;(as
in A and C, and the other older uncials): <emph>never</emph> ΤΕΛΟΣ.
But here is a Scribe who first copies the <emph>liturgical</emph> note ΤΕΛΟΣ,&mdash;and
then volunteers the <emph>critical</emph> observation that <q>in some
copies of S. Mark's Gospel the Evangelist proceeds no further!</q>
A more extraordinary corroboration of the view
which I am endeavouring to recommend to the reader's
acceptance, I really cannot imagine. Why, the ancient
Copyist actually comes back, in order to assure me that
the suggestion which I have been already offering in explanation
of the difficulty, is the true one!
</p>

<p>
5. I am not about to abuse the reader's patience with
a prolonged enumeration of the many additional conspiring
circumstances,&mdash;insignificant in themselves and confessedly
unimportant when considered singly, but of which the cumulative
force is unquestionably great,&mdash;which an examination
of 99 MSS. of the Gospels brought to light.<note place="foot"><p>(1) In Evan. 282
(written <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 1176),&mdash;a codex which <emph>has been
adapted</emph> to Lectionary purposes,&mdash;the sign τελ and ετ, strange to say,
<emph>is inserted into the body of the Text, only at S. Mark</emph> xv. 47
<emph>and</emph> xvi. 8.
</p>
<p>
(2) Evan. 268, (a truly superb MS., evidently left unfinished, the pictures
of the Evangelists only sketched in ink,) was never prepared for Lectionary
purposes; which makes it the more remarkable that, between ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ
and ἀναστάς, should be found inserted into the body of the text, τὲ. in gold.
</p>
<p>
(3) I have often met with copies of S. Matthew's, or of S. Luke's, or of
S. John's Gospel, unfurnished with a subscription in which ΤΕΛΟΣ occurs: but
scarcely ever have I seen an instance of a Codex where the Gospel <emph>according
to S. Mark</emph> was one of two, or of three from which it was wanting; much less
where it stood alone in that respect. On the other hand, in the following
Codices,&mdash;Evan. 10: 22: 30: 293,&mdash;S. Mark's is <emph>the only Gospel of
the Four</emph> which is furnished with the subscription, + τέλος τοῦ κατὰ Μάρκον
εὐαγγελίου [cross] or simply + τέλος + .... In Evan. 282, S. Matthew's Gospel shares this
peculiarity with S. Mark's.
</p></note> Enough
has been said already to shew,
</p>

<p>
(1st.) That it must have been a customary thing, at
a very remote age, to write the word ΤΕΛΟΣ against S. Mark
xvi. 8, even when the same note was withheld from the
close of almost every other ecclesiastical lection in the
Gospel.
</p>

<p>
(2ndly.) That this word, or rather note, which no doubt
<pb n="232"/><anchor id="Pg232"/>
was originally written as a liturgical memorandum in the
margin, became at a very early period incorporated with the
text; where, retaining neither its use nor its significancy, it
was liable to misconception, and may have easily come to be
fatally misunderstood.
</p>

<p>
And although these two facts certainly prove nothing in
and by themselves, yet, when brought close alongside of the
problem which has to be solved, their significancy becomes
immediately apparent: for,
</p>

<p>
(3rdly.) As a matter of fact, there are found to have
existed before the time of Eusebius, copies of S. Mark's
Gospel which <emph>did</emph> come to an end at this very place. Now,
that <emph>the Evangelist</emph> left off there, no one can
believe.<note place="foot"><q>Nemini in mentem venire potest Marcum narrationis suae
filum ineptissime abrupisse verbis&mdash;ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ.</q>&mdash;Griesbach
<hi rend='italic'>Comment. Crit.</hi> (ii. 197.) So, in fact,
<hi rend='italic'>uno ore</hi> all the Critics.</note> <emph>Why</emph>,
then, did <emph>the Scribe</emph> leave off? But the Reader is already
in possession of the reason why. A sufficient explanation of
the difficulty has been elicited from the very MSS. themselves.
And surely when, suspended to an old chest which
has been locked up for ages, a key is still hanging which
fits the lock exactly and enables men to open the chest with
ease, they are at liberty to assume that the key <emph>belongs</emph> to
the lock; is, in fact, the only instrument by which the chest
may lawfully be opened.
</p>

<p>
XI. And now, in conclusion, I propose that we summon
back our original Witness, and invite him to syllable his
evidence afresh, in order that we may ascertain if perchance
it affords any countenance whatever to the view which I have
been advocating. Possible at least it is that in the Patristic
record that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were anciently defective
from the 8th verse onwards <emph>some</emph> vestige may be discoverable
of the forgotten truth. Now, it has been already
fully shewn that it is a mistake to introduce into this discussion
any other name but that of Eusebius.<note place="foot"><ref target="Chapter_V">Chap.
V</ref>. See above, pp. <ref target="Pg066">66-7</ref>.</note> Do, then, the
terms in which <emph>Eusebius</emph> alludes to this matter lend us any
assistance? Let us have the original indictment read over
to us once more: and <emph>this</emph> time we are bound to listen to
every word of it with the utmost possible attention.
</p>

<pb n="233"/><anchor id="Pg233"/>

<p>
1. A problem is proposed for solution. <q>There are two
ways of solving it,</q> (Eusebius begins):&mdash;ὁ μὲν γὰρ [τὸ κεφάλαιον
αὐτὸ] τὴν τοῦτο φάσκουσαν περικοπὴν ἀθετῶν, εἔποι ἀν
μὴ ἐν ἅπασιν αὐτην φέρεσθαι τοῖς ἀντιγράφοις τοῦ κατὰ
Μάρκον εὐαγγελίου: τὰ γοῦν ἀκριβῆ τῶν ἀντιγράφων ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ
περιγράφει τῆς κατὰ τὸν Μάρκον ἱστορίας ἐν τοῖς λόγοις
κ.τ.λ. οἶς ἐπιλέγει, <q>καὶ οὐδενὶ οὐδὲν εἶπον, ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ.</q>
Ἐν τούτῳ σχεδὸν ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς ἀντιγράφοις τοῦ κατά Μάρκον
εὐαγγελίου περιγέγραπται ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ<note place="foot">The English reader will follow the
text with sufficient exactness if he will refer back, and read from the last line of
p. <ref target="Pg044">44</ref> to the ninth line of p. 45; taking care to see, in
two places, for <q>the end,</q>&mdash;<q><hi rend="smallcaps">the end</hi></q>.... The
entire context of the Greek is given in the <ref target="Appendix_B">Appendix
(B)</ref>.</note> ... Let us halt here for one moment.
</p>

<p>
2. Surely, a new and unexpected light already begins to
dawn upon this subject! How is it that we paid so little
attention before to the terms in which this ancient Father
delivers his evidence, that we overlooked the import of an
expression of his which from the first must have struck us as
peculiar, but which <emph>now</emph> we perceive to be of paramount significancy?
Eusebius is pointing out that <emph>one</emph> way for a man
(so minded) to get rid of the apparent inconsistency between
S. Mark xvi. 9 and S. Matth. xxviii. 1, would be for him to
reject the entire <q>Ecclesiastical Lection</q><note place="foot">τὴν τοῦτο φάσκουσαν
περικοπήν. The antecedent phrase, (τὸ κεφάλαιον αὐτό,) I suspect must be an
explanatory gloss.</note> in which S. Mark
xvi. 9 occurs. Any one adopting this course, (he proceeds;
and it is much to be noted that Eusebius is throughout delivering
the imaginary sentiments of another,&mdash;not his own:)
Such an one (he says) <q>will say that it is <emph>not met with in all</emph>
the copies of S. Mark's Gospel. The accurate copies, at all
events,</q>&mdash;and then follows an expression in which this
ancient Critic is observed ingeniously to accommodate his
language to the phenomenon which he has to describe, so as
covertly to insinuate something else. Eusebius employs an
idiom (it is found elsewhere in his writings) sufficiently
colourless to have hitherto failed to arouse attention; but
of which it is impossible to overlook the actual design
and import, after all that has gone before. He clearly
<emph>recognises the very phenomenon to which I have been calling
<pb n="234"/><anchor id="Pg234"/>
attention</emph> within the last two pages, and which I need not
further insist upon or explain: viz. that <emph>the words</emph> ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ
<emph>were</emph> in some very ancient (<q><emph>the accurate</emph></q>) copies
<emph>found written after</emph> ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ: although to an unsuspicious reader
the expression which he uses may well seem to denote
nothing more than that the second Gospel <emph>generally came
to an end</emph> there.
</p>

<p>
3. And now it is time to direct attention to the important
bearing of the foregoing remark on the main point at issue.
The true import of what Eusebius has delivered, and which
has at last been ascertained, will be observed really to set
his evidence in a novel and unsuspected light. From the
days of Jerome, it has been customary to assume that Eusebius
roundly states that, in his time <emph>almost all the Greek
copies</emph> were without our <q>last Twelve Verses</q> of S. Mark's
Gospel:<note place="foot"><q>This then is clear,</q> (is Dr. Tregelles' comment,)
<q>that the greater part of the Greek copies had not the verses in
question.</q>&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 247.</note>
whereas Eusebius really <emph>does nowhere say so</emph>. He
expresses himself enigmatically, resorting to a somewhat unusual
phrase<note place="foot">Observe, the peculiarity of the expression in this place
of Eusebius consists entirely in his introduction of the words τὸ τέλος. Had he
merely said τὰ ἀκριβὴ τῶν ἀντιγράφων τὸ εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Μάρκον περιγράφει ἐν τοῖς λόγοις
κ.τ.λ. ... Ἐν τούτῳ γὰρ σχεδὸν ἐν ἅπασι τοῖς ἀντιγράφοις περιγέγραπται τὸ
κατὰ Μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον,&mdash;there would have been nothing extraordinary in
the mode of expression. We should have been reminded of such places as the
following in the writings of Eusebius himself:&mdash;Ὁ Κλήμης ... εἰς τὴν Κομόδου
τελευτὴν περιγράφει τοὺς χρόνους, (<hi rend='italic'>Hist. Eccl.</hi> lib. vi. c.
6.)&mdash;Ἱππόλυτος ἐπὶ τὸ πρῶτον ἔτος αὐτοκράτοπος Ἀλεξάνδρου τοὺς χρόνους περιγράφει,
(<hi rend='italic'>Ibid.</hi> c. 22. See the note of Valesius on the place.)&mdash;Or
this, referred to by Stephanus (<hi rend='italic'>in voce</hi>),&mdash;Ἑνὸς δ᾽ ἔτι
μνησθεὶς περιγράψω τὸν λόγον, (<hi rend='italic'>Praep. Evang.</hi> lib. vi. c. 10,
[p. 280 c, <hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1628].) But the substitution of τὸ τέλος for
τὸ εὐαγγέλιον wants explaining; and can be only satisfactorily explained in one
way.</note> which perhaps admits of no exact English counterpart:
but what he says clearly amounts to no more than
this,&mdash;that <q><emph>the accurate</emph> copies, at the words ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ,
circumscribe <hi rend="smallcaps">the end</hi> (ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ) of Mark's narrative:</q> that
<emph>there</emph>, <q>in almost all the Copies of the Gospel according to
Mark, is circumscribed <hi rend="smallcaps">the end</hi>.</q> He says no more. He
does not say that <emph>there</emph> <q>is circumscribed <emph>the Gospel</emph>.</q> As
for the twelve verses which follow, he merely declares that
they were <q><emph>not met with in all</emph> the copies;</q> i.e. that some
copies did not contain them. But this, so far from being
<pb n="235"/><anchor id="Pg235"/>
a startling statement, is no more than what Codd. B and א in
themselves are sufficient to establish. In other words, Eusebius,
(whose testimony on this subject as it is commonly
understood is so extravagant [see above, p. <ref target="Pg048">48-9</ref>,] as to carry
with it its own sufficient refutation,) is found to bear consistent
testimony to the two following modest propositions;
which, however, are not adduced by him as reasons for rejecting
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, but only as samples of <emph>what
might be urged</emph> by one desirous of shelving a difficulty suggested
by their contents;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1st.) That from <emph>some</emph> ancient copies of S. Mark's Gospel
these last Twelve Verses were away.
</p>

<p>
(2nd.) That in <emph>almost</emph> all the copies,&mdash;(whether mutilated
or not, he does not state,)&mdash;the words ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ were found
immediately after ver. 8; which, (he seems to hint,) let
those who please accept as evidence that there also is <emph>the end
of the Gospel</emph>.
</p>

<p>
4. But I cannot dismiss the testimony of Eusebius until
I have recorded my own entire conviction that this Father is
no more an original authority here than Jerome, or Hesychius,
or Victor.<note place="foot">See above, p. <ref target="Pg066">66</ref> and p.
<ref target="Pg067">67</ref>.</note> He is evidently adopting the language of
some more ancient writer than himself. I observe that he
introduces the problem with the remark that what follows
is one of tho questions <q>for ever mooted by every body.</q><note place="foot">Πάρειμι
νῦν ... πρὸς τῷ τέλει τῶν αὐτῶν πάντοτε τοῖς πᾶσι ζητούμενα
[<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>].&mdash;Mai, vol. iv. p. 255.</note>
I suspect (with Matthaei, [<hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg066">66</ref>,]) that <emph>Origen</emph> is the
<emph>true</emph> author of all this confusion. He certainly relates of himself
that among his voluminous exegetical writings was a <emph>treatise
on S. Mark's Gospel</emph>.<note place="foot"><p><q>Consentit autem nobis ad
<emph>tractatum quem fecimus de scripturâ</emph> Marci.</q>&mdash;Origen.
(<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 929 B.) <hi rend='italic'>Tractat.</hi> xxxv. in
<hi rend='italic'>Matth.</hi> [I owe the reference to Cave (i. 118.) It seems to have
escaped the vigilance of Huet.]&mdash;This serves to explain why Victor of Antioch's
Catena on S. Mark was sometimes anciently attributed to Origen: as in Paris Cod. 703,
[<hi rend='italic'>olim</hi> 2330, 958, and 1048: also 18.] where is read (at fol.
247), Ὠριγένους πρόλογος εἰς τὴν ἑρμηνείαν τοῦ κατὰ Μάρκον εὐαγγελίου. Note, that
Reg. 937 is but a (xvi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> cent.) counterpart of the
preceding; which has been transcribed [xviii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
cent.] in Par. Suppl. Grace. 40.
</p>
<p>
Possevinus [<hi rend='italic'>Apparat. Sac.</hi> ii. 542,] (quoted by Huet,
<hi rend='italic'>Origeniana</hi>, p. 274) states that there is in the Library of
C.C.C., Oxford, a Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel by Origen. The source of this
misstatement has been acutely pointed out to me by the Rev. W. R. Churton. James,
in his <q>Ecloga Oxonio-Cantabrig.,</q> (1600, lib. i. p. 49,) mentions
<q><emph>Homiliae Origenis super Evangelio Marcae</emph>, Stabat ad
monumentum.</q>&mdash;Read instead, (with Rev. H. O. Coxe, <q>Cat. Codd. MSS.
C.C.C.;</q> [No. 142, 4,]) as follows:&mdash;<q>Origenis presb. Hom. in istud
Johannis, <emph>Maria stabat ad monumentum</emph>,</q> &amp;c. But what
actually led Possevinus astray, I perceive, was James's consummation of his own
blunder in lib. ii. p. 49,&mdash;which Possevinus has simply appropriated.
</p></note> To Origen's works, Eusebius, (his
<pb n="236"/><anchor id="Pg236"/>
apologist and admirer,) is known to have habitually resorted;
and, like many others, to have derived not a few
of his notions from that fervid and acute, but most erratic
intellect. Origen's writings in short, seem to have been
the source of much, if not most of the mistaken Criticism
of Antiquity. (The reader is reminded of what has been
offered above at p. <ref target="Pg096">96-7</ref>). And this would not be the first
occasion on which it would appear that when an ancient
Writer speaks of <q><emph>the accurate copies</emph></q>, what he actually
<emph>means is the text of Scripture which was employed or approved
by Origen</emph>.<note place="foot"><p>So Chrysostom, speaking of the reading Βηθαβαρά.
</p>
<p>
Origen (iv. 140) says that not only σχεδὸν ἐν πᾶσι τοῖς ἀντιγράφοις, but also
that <emph>apud Heracleonem</emph>, (who wrote within 50 years of S. John's death,) he
found Βηθανία written in S. John i. 28. Moved by <emph>geographical</emph>
considerations, however, (as he explains,) for Βηθανία, Origen proposes to read
Βηθαβαρά.&mdash;Chrysostom (viii. 96 d), after noticing the former reading,
declares,&mdash;ὅσα δὲ τῶν ἀντιγράφων ἀκριβέστερον ἔχει ἐν Βηθαβαρά φησιν: but he
goes on <emph>to reproduce Origen's reasoning</emph>;&mdash;thereby betraying
himself.&mdash;The author of the <hi rend='italic'>Catena in Matth.</hi> (Cramer, i.
190-1) simply reproduces Chrysostom:&mdash;χρὴ δὲ γινώσκειν ὅτι τὰ ἀκριβῆ τῶν
ἀντιγράφων ἐν Βηθαβαρὰ περιέχει. And so, other Scholia; until at last what was only
due to the mistaken assiduity of Origen, became generally received as the reading
of the <q>more accurate copies.</q>
</p>
<p>
A scholium on S. Luke xxiv. 13, in like manner, declares that the true reading
of that place is not <q>60</q> but <q>160,</q>&mdash;οὕτως γὰρ τὰ ἀκριβῆ περιέχει, καὶ ἡ
Ὠριγένους τῆς ἀληθείας βεβαίωσις. Accordingly, <emph>Eusebius</emph> also reads the place
in the same erroneous way.
</p></note> The more attentively the language of Eusebius
in this place is considered, the more firmly (it is
thought) will the suspicion be entertained that he is here
only reproducing the sentiments of another person. But,
however this may be, it is at least certain that the precise
meaning of what he says, has been hitherto generally overlooked.
He certainly does <emph>not</emph> say, as Jerome, from his
loose translation of the passage,<note place="foot">Jerome says of himself
(<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vii. 537,)&mdash;<q>Non digne Græca in Latinum
transfero: aut Græcos lege (si ejusdem linguae habes scientiam) aut si tantum
Latinus es, noli de gratuito munere judicare, et, ut vulgare proverbium est:
<emph>equi dentes inspicere donati</emph>.</q></note> evidently
imagined,&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>omnibus
<pb n="237"/><anchor id="Pg237"/>
Graeciae libris pene hoc capitulum in fine non habentibus</hi>:</q>
but only,&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>non in omnibus Evangelii exemplaribus hoc capitulum
inveniri</hi>;</q> which is an entirely different thing. Eusebius
adds,&mdash;<q>Accuratiora saltem exemplaria <hi rend="smallcaps">finem</hi> narrationis
secundum Marcum circumscribunt in verbis ἐφοβοῦντο
γάρ;</q>&mdash;and, <q>In hoc, fere in omnibus exemplaribus Evangelii
secundum Marcum, <hi rend="smallcaps">finem</hi> circumscribi.</q>&mdash;The point,
however, of greatest interest is, that Eusebius here calls attention
to the prevalence in MSS. of his time of the very <emph>liturgical
peculiarity</emph> which plainly supplies the one true solution of
the problem under discussion. His testimony is a marvellous
corroboration of what we learn from Cod. 22, (see
above, p. <ref target="Pg230">230</ref>,) and, rightly understood, does not go a whit
beyond it.
</p>

<p>
5. What wonder that Hesychius, because he adopted
blindly what he found in Eusebius, should at once betray
his author and exactly miss the point of what his author
says? Τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον εὐαγγέλιον (so he writes) μέχρι τοῦ
<q>ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ,</q> ἔχει ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ.<note place="foot">See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg057">57-9</ref>: also <ref target="Appendix_C">Appendix (C)</ref>, §
2.</note>
</p>

<p>
6. This may suffice concerning the testimony of Eusebius.&mdash;It
will be understood that I suppose Origen to have fallen
in with one or more copies of S. Mark's Gospel which exhibited
<emph>the Liturgical hint</emph>, (ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ,) conspicuously written
against S. Mark xvi. 9. Such a copy may, or may not,
have there terminated abruptly. I suspect however that it
<emph>did</emph>. Origen at all events, (<hi rend='italic'>more suo</hi>,) will have
remarked on the phenomenon before him; and Eusebius will have
adopted his remarks,&mdash;as the heralds say, <q>with <emph>a
difference</emph></q>&mdash;simply because they suited his purpose, and seemed
to him ingenious and interesting.
</p>

<p>
7. For the copy in question,&mdash;(<emph>like</emph> that other copy of
S. Mark from which the Peshito translation was made, and
in which ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ most inopportunely occurs at chap. xiv.
41,<note place="foot">See above, pp. <ref target="Pg225">225-6</ref>.</note>)&mdash;will
have become the progenitor of several other
copies (as Codd. B and א); and some of these, it is pretty
evident, were familiarly known to Eusebius.
</p>

<pb n="238"/><anchor id="Pg238"/>

<p>
8. Let it however be clearly borne in mind that nothing
of all this is in the least degree essential to my argument.
Eusebius, (for aught that I know or care,) may be <emph>solely</emph>
responsible for every word that he has delivered concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20. Every link in my argument will remain
undisturbed, and the conclusion will be still precisely
the same, whether the mistaken Criticism before us originated
with another or with himself.
</p>

<p>
XII. But <emph>why</emph>, (it may reasonably be asked,)&mdash;<emph>Why</emph> should
there have been anything exceptional in the way of indicating
the end of this particular Lection? <emph>Why</emph> should
τέλος be so constantly found written after S. Mark xvi. 8?
</p>

<p>
I answer,&mdash;I suppose it was because the Lections which
respectively ended and began at that place were so many,
and were Lections of such unusual importance. Thus,&mdash;(1)
On the 2nd Sunday after Easter, (κυριακή γ᾽ τῶν μυροφόρων,
as it was called,) at the Liturgy, was read S. Mark
xv. 43 to xvi. 8; and (2) on the same day at Matins, (by
the Melchite Syrian Christians as well as by the Greeks,<note place="foot">R. Payne
Smith's <hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi> p. 116.</note>)
S. Mark xvi. 9-20. The severance, therefore, was at ver. 8.
(3) In certain of the Syrian Churches the liturgical section
for Easter Day was S. Mark xvi 2-8:<note place="foot">See Adler's N. T.
<hi rend='italic'>Verss. Syrr.</hi>, p. 70.</note> in the Churches of
the Jacobite, or Monophysite Christians, the Eucharistic
lesson for Easter-Day was ver. 1-8.<note place="foot">R. Payne Smith's
<hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi> p. 146.</note> (4) The second matin
lesson of the Resurrection (xvi. 1-8) also ends,&mdash;and (5)
the third (xvi. 9-20) begins, at the same place: and these
two Gospels (both in the Greek and in the Syrian Churches)
were in constant use not only at Easter, but throughout the
year.<note place="foot">See p. <ref target="Pg206">206</ref>, also note (k).</note>
(6) <emph>That</emph> same third matin lesson of the Resurrection
was also the Lesson at Matins on Ascension-Day; as
well in the Syrian<note place="foot">R. Payne Smith's <hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi>
p. 117.</note> as in the Greek<note place="foot"><p>Accordingly, in Cod. Evan. 266
(= Paris Reg. 67) is read, at S. Mark xvi. 8 (<hi rend='italic'>fol</hi>. 125), as
follows:&mdash;ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ. [then, <hi rend='italic'>rubro</hi>,] τέλος τοῦ Β᾽ ἑωθίνου,
καὶ τῆς κυριακῆς τῶν μυροφόρων. ἀρχή. [then the text:] Ἀναστάς κ.τ.λ. ... After ver.
20, (at <hi rend='italic'>fol</hi>. 126 of the same Codex) is found the following
concluding rubric:&mdash;τέλος τοῦ Γ᾽ ἑωθίνου εὐαγγελίου.
</p>
<p>
In the same place, (viz. at the end of S. Mark's Gospel,) is found in another
Codex (Evan. 7 = Paris Reg. 71,) the following rubric:&mdash;τέλος τοῦ τρίτου τοῦ
ἑωθίνου, καὶ τοῦ ὄρθρου τῆς ἀναλήψεως.
</p></note> Churches. (7) With
<pb n="239"/><anchor id="Pg239"/>
the Monophysite Christians, the lection <q>feriae tertiae in
albis, ad primam vesperam,</q> (i.e. for the Tuesday in Easter-Week)
was S. Mark xv. 37-xvi. 8: and (8) on the same
day, at Matins, ch. xvi. 9-18.<note place="foot">R. Payne Smith's
<hi rend='italic'>Catal.</hi> p. 146.</note>&mdash;During eighteen weeks
after Easter therefore, <emph>the only parts</emph> of S. Mark's Gospel
publicly read were (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) the last thirteen [ch. xv. 43-xvi. 8],
and (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) <q><emph>the last twelve</emph></q> [ch. xvi. 9-20]
verses. Can it be deemed a strange thing that it should have been found
<emph>indispensable</emph> to mark, with altogether exceptional emphasis,&mdash;to
make it unmistakably plain,&mdash;where the former Lection
came to an end, and where the latter Lection began?<note place="foot"><p>Cod. 27 (xi)
is not provided with any lectionary apparatus, and is written
continuously throughout: and yet at S. Mark xvi. 9 a fresh paragraph is
observed to commence.
</p>
<p>
Not dissimilar is the phenomenon recorded in respect of some copies of the
Armenian version. <q>The Armenian, in the edition of Zohrab, separates the
concluding 12 verses from the rest of the Gospel.... Many of the oldest MSS.,
after the words ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ, put the final Εὐαγγέλιον κατὰ Μάρκον, and then
give the additional verses with a new superscription.</q> (Tregelles,
<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 253).... We are now in a position to
<emph>understand</emph> the Armenian evidence, which has been described above, at p.
<ref target="Pg036">36</ref>, as well as to estimate its
exact value.
</p></note>
</p>

<p>
XIII. One more circumstance, and but one, remains to
be adverted to in the way of evidence; and one more suggestion
to be offered. The circumstance is familiar indeed
to all, but its bearing on the present discussion has never
been pointed out. I allude to the fact that anciently, in
copies of the fourfold Gospel, <emph>the Gospel according to S. Mark
frequently stood last</emph>.
</p>

<p>
This is memorably the case in respect of the Codex Bezae
[vi]: more memorably yet, in respect of the Gothic version
of Ulphilas (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 360): in both of which MSS., the order
of the Gospels is (1) S. Matthew, (2) S. John, (3) S. Luke,
(4) S. Mark. This is in fact <emph>the usual Western order</emph>. Accordingly
it is thus that the Gospels stand in the Codd. Vercellensis
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>), Veronensis (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>), Palatinus
(<hi rend='italic'>e</hi>), Brixianus (<hi rend='italic'>f</hi>) of the
old Latin version. But this order is not <emph>exclusively</emph> Western.
It is found in Cod. 309. It is also observed in Matthaei's
Codd. 13, 14, (which last is <emph>our</emph> Evan. 256), at Moscow. And
<pb n="240"/><anchor id="Pg240"/>
in the same order Eusebius and others of the ancients<note place="foot">Euseb. apud
Mai, iv. p. 264 = p. 287. Again at p. 289-90.&mdash;So also the author of the 2nd
Homily on the Resurr. (Greg. Nyss. <hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 411-2.)&mdash;And
see the third of the fragments ascribed to Polycarp. <hi rend='italic'>Patres
Apostol.</hi>, (ed. Jacobson) ii. p. 515.</note> are
occasionally observed to refer to the four Gospels,&mdash;which
induces a suspicion that they were not unfamiliar with it.
Nor is this all. In Codd. 19 and 90 the Gospel according
to S. Mark stands last; though in the former of these the
order of the three antecedent Gospels is (1) S. John, (2) S.
Matthew, (3) S. Luke;<note place="foot">I believe this will be found to be the
<emph>invariable</emph> order of the Gospels <emph>in the Lectionaries</emph>.</note>
in the latter, (1) S. John, (2) S. Luke,
(3) S. Matthew. What need of many words to explain the
bearing of these facts on the present discussion? Of course
it will have <emph>sometimes</emph> happened that S. Mark xvi. 8 came to
be written <emph>at the bottom of the left hand page</emph> of a
MS.<note place="foot">This is the case for instance in Evan. 15 (= Reg. 64). See
<hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 98 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>.</note> And
we have but to suppose that in the case of one such Codex
the next leaf, which would have been <emph>the last</emph>, was
missing,&mdash;(<emph>the very thing which has happened in respect of one of the
Codices at Moscow</emph><note place="foot"><p>I allude of course to Matthaei's Cod.
g. (See the note in his <hi rend='italic'>N. T.</hi> vol. ix. p. 228.) Whether or no
the learned critic was right in his conjecture <q>aliquot folia excidisse,</q>
matters nothing. <emph>The left hand page ends at the words</emph> ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ.
Now, if τελος had followed, how obvious would have been the inference that the Gospel
itself of S. Mark had come to an end there!
</p>
<p>
Note, that in the Codex Bezæ (D), S. Mark's Gospel ends at ver. 15: in the Gothic
Codex Argenteus, at ver. 11. The Codex Vercell. (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) proves to
be imperfect from ch. xv. 15; Cod. Veron. (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) from xiii. 24;
Cod. Brix. (<hi rend='italic'>f</hi>) from xiv. 70.</p></note>)&mdash;and what else
<emph>could</emph> result when a copyist reached the words,
</p>

<p>
ΕΦΟΒΟΥΝΤΟ ΓΑΡ. ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ
</p>

<p>
but the very phenomenon which has exercised critics so sorely
and which gives rise to the whole of the present discussion?
The copyist will have brought S. Mark's Gospel to an end
there, <emph>of course</emph>. What else could he possibly do?...
Somewhat less excusably was our learned countryman Mill
betrayed into the statement, (inadvertently adopted by Wetstein,
Griesbach, and Tischendorf,) that <q>the last verse of
S. John's Gospel <emph>is omitted</emph> in Cod. 63:</q> the truth of the
matter being (as Mr. Scrivener has lately proved) that <emph>the
<pb n="241"/><anchor id="Pg241"/>
last leaf</emph> of Cod. 63,&mdash;on which the last verse of S. John's
Gospel was demonstrably once written,&mdash;<emph>has been
lost</emph>.<note place="foot">Scrivener, <hi rend='italic'>Coll. Cod. Sin.</hi> p.
lix.</note>
</p>

<p>
XIV. To sum up.
</p>

<p>
1. It will be perceived that I suppose the omission of
<q>the last Twelve Verses</q> of S. Mark's Gospel to have
originated in a sheer error and misconception on the part
of some very ancient Copyist. He <emph>saw</emph> ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ written after
ver. 8: he <emph>assumed</emph> that it was the Subscription, or at least
that it denoted <q>the End,</q> <emph>of the Gospel</emph>.
</p>

<p>
2. Whether certain ancient Critics, because it was acceptable
to them, were not found to promote this mistake,&mdash;it
is useless to inquire. That there may have arisen some
old harmonizer of the Gospels, who, (in the words of Eusebius,)
was disposed to <q>regard what followed as superfluous
from its seeming inconsistency with the testimony of
the other Evangelists;</q><note place="foot">See p.
<ref target="Pg227">227</ref>.</note>&mdash;and that in this way the error
became propagated;&mdash;is likely enough. But an error it
most certainly was: and to that <emph>error</emph>, the <emph>accident</emph> described
in the last preceding paragraph <emph>would have</emph> very materially
conduced, and it may have very easily done so.
</p>

<p>
3. I request however that it may be observed that the
<q>accident</q> is not <emph>needed</emph> in order to account for the <q>error.</q>
The mere presence of ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ at ver. 8, so near the end of
the Gospel, would be quite enough to occasion it. And we
have seen that in very ancient times the word ΤΕΛΟΣ frequently
<emph>did</emph> occur in an altogether exceptional manner in
that very place. Moreover, we have ascertained that its
meaning was <emph>not understood</emph> by the transcribers of ancient
MSS.
</p>

<p>
4. And will any one venture to maintain that it is to him
a thing incredible that an intelligent copyist of the
iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century,
because he read the words ΤΟ ΤΕΛΟΣ at S. Mark xvi. 8,
can have been beguiled thereby into the supposition that
those words indicated <q>the End</q> of <emph>S. Mark's Gospel</emph>?&mdash;Shall
I be told that, even if <emph>one</emph> can have so entirely overlooked
the meaning of the liturgical sign as to suffer it
to insinuate itself into his text,<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg226">226</ref>.</note> it is nevertheless so improbable
<pb n="242"/><anchor id="Pg242"/>
as to pass all credence that <emph>another</emph> can have supposed
that it designated <emph>the termination of the Gospel</emph> of the second
Evangelist?&mdash;For all reply, I take leave to point out that
Scholz, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and Mai and the
rest of the Critics have, <emph>one and all, without exception, misunderstood
the same word occurring in the same place, and in
precisely the same way</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Yes. The forgotten inadvertence of a solitary Scribe in
the <emph>second</emph> or <emph>third</emph> century has been, <emph>in the
nineteenth</emph>, deliberately
reproduced, adopted, and stereotyped by every Critic
and every Editor of the New Testament in turn.
</p>

<p>
What wonder,&mdash;(I propose the question deliberately,)&mdash;What
wonder that an ancient Copyist should have been misled
by a phenomenon which in our own days is observed to
have imposed upon two generations of professed Biblical
Critics discussing this very textual problem, and therefore
fully on their guard against delusion?<note place="foot">So Scholz:&mdash;<q>hic
[sc. 22] post γὰρ + τέλος; dein atramento rubro,</q>
&amp;c.&mdash;Tischendorf,&mdash;<q>Testantur scholia ... <emph>Marci Evangelium</emph>
... versu 9 <emph>finem habuisse</emph>. Ita, ut de 30 fere Codd. certe tres videamus,
22 habet: ἐφοβουντο γαρ + τελος. εν τισι,</q> &amp;c.&mdash;Tregelles appeals to
copies, <q>sometimes with τέλος interposed after ver. 8,</q> (p. 254.)&mdash;Mai
(iv. 256) in the same spirit remarks,&mdash;<q>Codex Vaticano-palatinus [220], ex
quo Eusebium producimus, post octavum versum <emph>habet quidem</emph> vocem τέλος,
ut alibi interdum observatum fuit; <emph>sed tamen</emph> ibidem eadem manu
subscribitur incrementum cum progredientibus sectionum notis.</q></note> To this hour,
the illustrious Editors of the text of the Gospels are clearly, one
and all, labouring under the grave error of supposing that
<q>ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ + τέλος,</q>&mdash;(for which they are so careful
to refer us to <q>Cod. 22,</q>)&mdash;is an indication that <emph>there</emph>, by
rights, comes <emph>the <q><hi rend="smallcaps">End</hi></q> of the Gospel according to
S. Mark</emph>. They have failed to perceive that ΤΕΛΟΣ in that place is only
<emph>a liturgical sign</emph>,&mdash;the same with which (in its contracted
form) they are sufficiently familiar; and that it serves no
other purpose whatever, but to mark that <emph>there</emph> a famous
<emph>Ecclesiastical Lection</emph> comes to an end.

With a few pages of summary, we may now bring this
long disquisition to an end.

<p>
This Inquiry has at last reached its close. The problem
was fully explained at the outset.<note place="foot">Chap. I. and II.</note>
All the known evidence has since been produced,<note place="foot">Chap. IV, VI-X.</note>
every Witness examined.<note place="foot">Chap. III, V, and VIII.</note> Counsel
has been heard on both sides. A just Sentence will assuredly
follow. But it may not be improper that I should in conclusion
ask leave to direct attention to the <emph>single issue</emph> which
has to be decided, and which has been strangely thrust into
the background and practically kept out of sight, by those
who have preceded me in this Investigation. The case
stands simply thus:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
It being freely admitted that, in the beginning of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century,
there must have existed Copies of the Gospels
in which the last chapter of S. Mark extended no
further than ver. 8, the Question arises,&mdash;<emph>How is this phenomenon
to be accounted for?</emph>... The problem is not only
highly interesting and strictly legitimate, but it is even
inevitable. In the immediately preceding chapter, I have
endeavoured to solve it, and I believe in a wholly unsuspected
way.
</p>

<p>
But the most recent Editors of the text of the New Testament,
declining to entertain so much as the <emph>possibility</emph> that
certain copies of the second Gospel <emph>had experienced mutilation
in very early times</emph> in respect of these Twelve concluding
<pb n="244"/><anchor id="Pg244"/>
Verses, have chosen to occupy themselves rather with conjectures
as to how it may have happened that S. Mark's
Gospel <emph>was without a conclusion from the very first</emph>. Persuaded
that no more probable account is to be given of the phenomenon
than that <emph>the Evangelist himself put forth a Gospel
which</emph> (for some unexplained reason) <emph>terminated abruptly at
the words</emph> ἐφοβοῦντο γάρ (chap. xvi. 8),&mdash;they have unhappily
seen fit to illustrate the liveliness of this conviction
of theirs, by presenting the world with his Gospel mutilated
in this particular way. Practically, therefore, the question
has been reduced to the following single issue:&mdash;Whether
of the two suppositions which follow is the more reasonable:
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>First</hi>,&mdash;That the Gospel according to S. Mark, as it left the
hands of its inspired Author, <emph>was in this imperfect or unfinished
state</emph>; ending abruptly at (what we call now) the 8th verse
of the last chapter:&mdash;of which solemn circumstance, at the
end of eighteen centuries, Cod. B and Cod. א are the alone
surviving Manuscript witnesses?... or,
</p>

<p>
<hi rend='italic'>Secondly</hi>,&mdash;That certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel
<emph>having suffered mutilation</emph> in respect of their Twelve concluding
Verses in the post-Apostolic age, Cod. B and Cod. א are the
only examples of MSS. so mutilated which are known to
exist at the present day?
</p>

<p>
I. Editors who adopt the former hypothesis, are observed
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) to sever the Verses in question from their
context:<note place="foot">Tischendorf, Tregelles,
Alford.</note>&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) to introduce after ver. 8,
the subscription <q>ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ:</q><note place="foot">Tregelles,
Alford.</note>&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) to shut up verses 9-20 within
brackets.<note place="foot">Alford.</note> Regarding
them as <q>no integral part of the Gospel</q><note place="foot"><q>Hæc non a Marco
scripta esse argumentis probatur idoneis.</q>&mdash;See the rest of Tischendorf's
verdict, <hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>, p. <ref target="Pg010">10</ref>; and opposite,

down,</q><note place="foot">Tregelles' <hi rend='italic'>Account of the Printed

Test.</hi> vol. i. <hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi> [p. 38] and p. 437.</note>&mdash;they
consider themselves at liberty to go on to suggest that <q>the Evangelist
may have been interrupted in his work:</q> at any rate,
<pb n="245"/><anchor id="Pg245"/>
that <q>something may have occurred, (as the death of
S. Peter,) to cause him to leave it unfinished.</q><note place="foot">So Norton,
Tregelles, and others.</note> But <q>the
most probable supposition</q> (we are assured) <q>is, that <emph>the
last leaf of the original Gospel was torn away</emph>.</q><note place="foot">This
suggestion, which was originally Griesbach's, is found in Alford's <hi rend='italic'>New
Test.</hi> vol. i. p. 433, (<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> 1868.)&mdash;See above, p.
<ref target="Pg012">12</ref>. The italics are not mine.</note>
</p>

<p>
We listen with astonishment; contenting ourselves with
modestly suggesting that surely it will be time to conjecture
<emph>why</emph> S. Mark's Gospel was left by its Divinely inspired
Author in an unfinished state, when the fact has been established
that it probably <emph>was</emph> so left. In the meantime, we
request to be furnished with some evidence of <emph>that fact</emph>.
</p>

<p>
But not a particle of Evidence is forthcoming. It is not
even pretended that any such evidence exists. Instead, we
are magisterially informed by <q>the first Biblical Critic in
Europe,</q>&mdash;(I desire to speak of him with gratitude and respect,
but S. Mark's Gospel is a vast deal more precious to
me than Dr. Tischendorf's reputation,)&mdash;that <q><emph>a healthy piety
reclaims against the endeavours of those who are for palming
off as Mark's what the Evangelist is so plainly shewn</emph> [where?]
<emph>to have known nothing at all about</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Vide
<hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>, p. <ref target="Pg010">10</ref>.</note> In the meanwhile,
it is assumed to be a more reasonable supposition,&mdash;(α) That
S. Mark published an imperfect Gospel; and that the Twelve
Verses with which his Gospel concludes were the fabrication
of a subsequent age; than,&mdash;(β) That some ancient
Scribe having with design or by accident left out these
Twelve concluding Verses, copies of the second Gospel so
mutilated become multiplied, and in the beginning of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century existed in considerable numbers.
</p>

<p>
And yet it is notorious that very soon after the Apostolic
age, liberties precisely of this kind were freely taken with
the text of the New Testament. Origen (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 185-254)
complains of the licentious tampering with the Scriptures
which prevailed in his day. <q>Men add to them,</q> (he says)
<q>or <emph>leave out</emph>,&mdash;as seems good to
themselves.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. iii. p. 671.</note>
Dionysius of Corinth, yet earlier, (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 168-176) remarks that
it was no wonder his own writings were added to and <emph>taken from</emph>,
seeing that men presumed to deprave the Word of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>
<pb n="246"/><anchor id="Pg246"/>
in the same manner.<note place="foot">Eusebius <hi rend='italic'>Eccl. Hist.</hi> iv.
28. Consider Rev. xxii. 18, 19.</note> Irenæus, his contemporary, (living
within seventy years of S. John's death,) complains of a corrupted
Text.<note place="foot">Note the remarkable adjuration of Irenæus,

century, and the depravations of Holy Writ become avowed and
flagrant.<note place="foot">Allusion is made to the Gnostics Basilides and Valentinus;
especially to the work of Marcion.</note> A competent authority has declared it <q>no
less true to fact than paradoxical in sound, that <emph>the worst
corruptions to which the New Testament has been ever subjected</emph>
originated within a hundred years after it was
composed.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, pp.
381-391.</note> Above all, it is demonstrable that Cod. B and
Cod. א abound in unwarrantable omissions very like the present;<note place="foot">See
<ref target="Chapter_VI">Chap. VI</ref>.</note>
omissions which only do not provoke the same amount
of attention because they are of less moment. One such
extraordinary depravation of the Text, <emph>in which they also
stand alone among MSS.</emph> and to which their patrons are observed
to appeal with triumphant complacency, has been
already made the subject of distinct investigation. I am
much mistaken if it has not been shewn in my
VII<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter,
that the omission of the words ἐν Ἐφέσῳ from Ephes. i. 1,
is just as unauthorized,&mdash;quite as serious a blemish,&mdash;as the
suppression of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
</p>

<p>
Now, in the face of facts like these, and in the absence of
<emph>any Evidence whatever</emph> to prove that S. Mark's Gospel was
imperfect from the first,&mdash;I submit that an hypothesis so
violent and improbable, as well as so wholly uncalled for,
is simply undeserving of serious attention. For,
</p>

<p>
(1st.) It is plain from internal considerations that the
improbability of the hypothesis is excessive; <q>the contents
of these Verses being such as to preclude the supposition
that they were the work of a post-Apostolic period. The
very difficulties which they present afford the strongest presumption
of their genuineness.</q> No fabricator of a supplement
to S. Mark's Gospel would have ventured on introducing
so many minute <emph>seeming</emph> discrepancies: and certainly
<pb n="247"/><anchor id="Pg247"/>
<q>his contemporaries would not have accepted and
transmitted such an addition,</q> if he had. It has also been
shewn at great length that the Internal Evidence for the
genuineness of these Verses is overwhelmingly
strong.<note place="foot"><ref target="Chapter_IX">Chap. IX</ref>.</note> But,
</p>

<p>
(2nd.) Even external Evidence is not wanting. It has
been acutely pointed out long since, that the absence of
a vast assemblage of various Readings in this place, is, in
itself, a convincing argument that we have here to do with
no spurious appendage to the Gospel.<note place="foot"><q>Ad defendendum hunc locum
in primis etiam valet mirus Codicum consensus in vocabulis et loquendi formulis
singulis. Nam in locis παρεγγράπτοις, etiam multo brevioribus, quo plures sunt Codices,
eo plures quoque sunt varietates. Comparetur modo Act. xv. 18, Matth. viii. 13, et
loca similia.</q>&mdash;C. F. Matthaei's <hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (1788) vol.
ii. p. 271.</note> Were this a deservedly
suspected passage, it must have shared the fate of
all other deservedly (or undeservedly) suspected passages.
It never could have come to pass that the various Readings
which these Twelve Verses exhibit would be <emph>considerably
fewer</emph> than those which attach to the last twelve verses of
any of the other three Gospels.
</p>

<p>
(3rd.) And then surely, if the original Gospel of S. Mark
had been such an incomplete work as is feigned, the fact
would have been notorious from the first, and must needs
have become the subject of general comment.<note place="foot">Speaking of the abrupt
termination of the second Gospel at ver. 8, Dr. Tregelles asks,&mdash;<q>Would this
have been transmitted as a fact by good witnesses, if there had not been real grounds
for regarding it to be true?</q>&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>Printed Text</hi>, p. 257.)
Certainly not, we answer. But <emph>where</emph> are the <q>good witnesses</q> of the
<q>transmitted fact?</q> <emph>There is not so much as one.</emph></note> It may be
regarded as certain that so extraordinary a circumstance
would have been largely remarked upon by the Ancients, and
that evidence of the fact would have survived in a hundred
quarters. It is, I repeat, simply incredible that Tradition
would have proved so utterly neglectful of her office as to
remain <emph>quite</emph> silent on such a subject, if the facts had been
such as are imagined. Either Papias, or else John the Presbyter,&mdash;Justin
Martyr, or Hegesippus, or one of the <q>Seniores
apud Irenæum,</q>&mdash;Clemens Alexandrinus, or Tertullian,
or Hippolytus,&mdash;if not Origen, yet at least Eusebius,&mdash;if not
<pb n="248"/><anchor id="Pg248"/>
Eusebius, yet certainly Jerome,&mdash;<emph>some</emph> early Writer, I say,
must <emph>certainly</emph> have recorded the tradition that S. Mark's
Gospel, as it came from the hands of its inspired author, was
an incomplete or unfinished work. The silence of the Ancients,
joined to the inherent improbability of the conjecture,&mdash;(<emph>that</emph>
silence so profound, <emph>this</emph> improbability so gross!)&mdash;is
enough, I submit, <emph>in the entire absence of Evidence on the
other side</emph>, to establish <emph>the very contradictory</emph> of the alternative
which recent Critics are so strenuous in recommending to
our acceptance.
</p>

<p>
(4th.) But on the contrary. We have indirect yet convincing
testimony that the <emph>oldest</emph> copies of all <emph>did contain</emph> the
Verses in question:<note place="foot">See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg086">86-90</ref>.</note> while so far are any of the Writers
just now enumerated from recording that these verses were
absent from the early copies, that five out of those ten
Fathers actually quote, or else refer to the verses in question
in a way which shews that in their day they were the recognised
termination of S. Mark's Gospel.<note place="foot">See
<ref target="Chapter_III">Chap. III</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
We consider ourselves at liberty, therefore, to turn our
attention to the rival alternative. Our astonishment is even
excessive that it should have been seriously expected of us
that we could accept without Proof of any sort,&mdash;without
a particle of Evidence, external, internal, or even traditional,&mdash;the
extravagant hypothesis that S. Mark put forth an
unfinished Gospel; when the obvious and easy alternative
solicits us, of supposing,
</p>

<p>
II. That, at some period <emph>subsequent</emph> to the time of the
Evangelist, certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel suffered that
mutilation in respect of their last Twelve Verses of which
we meet with <emph>no trace whatever, no record of any sort, until
the beginning of the fourth century</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(i.) And the facts which <emph>now</emph> meet us on the very threshold,
are in a manner conclusive: for if Papias and Justin
Martyr [<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 150] do not refer to, yet certainly Irenæus
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 185] and Hippolytus [<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
190-227] <emph>distinctly quote</emph> Six out of the Twelve suspected
Verses,&mdash;which are also met with in the two oldest Syriac Versions, as well as
in the old Latin Translation. Now the latest of these authorities is
<pb n="249"/><anchor id="Pg249"/>
earlier by full a hundred years than <emph>the earliest record</emph> that
the verses in question were ever absent from ancient MSS.
At the eighth Council of Carthage, (as Cyprian relates,)
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 256] Vincentius a Thiberi, one of the eighty-seven
African Bishops there assembled, quoted the 17th verse in
the presence of the Council.
</p>

<p>
(ii.) Nor is this all.<note place="foot">See above, Chap. III. and IV.</note>
Besides the Gothic and Egyptian versions in the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century; besides Ambrose, Cyril of Alexandria,
Jerome, and Augustine in the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, to say nothing of
Codices A and C;&mdash;the Lectionary of the Church universal,
<emph>probably from the second century of our æra</emph>, is found to bestow
its solemn and emphatic sanction on <emph>every one</emph> of these Twelve
Verses. They are met with <emph>in every MS. of the Gospels in
existence</emph>, uncial and cursive,&mdash;<emph>except
two</emph>;<note place="foot"><q>Habent periocham hanc Codices Græci, si unum b
excipias, omnes.</q> (Scholz, adopting the statement of Griesbach.)&mdash;See above, p.
<ref target="Pg070">70</ref>.</note> they are found <emph>in
every Version</emph>; and are contained besides in <emph>every known Lectionary</emph>,
where they are appointed to be read at Easter and
on Ascension Day.<note place="foot">See above, Chap. X.</note>
</p>

<p>
(iii.) Early in the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century, however, we
are encountered by a famous place in the writings of Eusebius
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 300-340], who, (as I have elsewhere
explained,<note place="foot">See above, pp. <ref target="Pg066">66-68</ref>.</note>)
is the <emph>only</emph> Father who delivers any independent testimony on this subject
at all. What he says has been strangely misrepresented.
It is simply as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) One, <q>Marinus,</q> is introduced <emph>quoting this part of
S. Mark's Gospel without suspicion</emph>, and enquiring, How its
opening statement is to be reconciled with S. Matth. xxviii. 1?
Eusebius, in reply, points out that a man whose only object
was to get rid of the difficulty, might adopt the expedient of
saying that this last section of S. Mark's Gospel <q>is <emph>not
found in all the copies</emph>:</q> (μὴ ἐν ἁπᾶσι φέρεσθαι.) Declining,
however, to act thus presumptuously in respect of anything
claiming to be a part of Evangelical Scripture, (οὐδ᾽ ὁτιοῦν
τολμῶν ἀθετεῖν τῶν ὁπωσοῦν ἐν τῇ τῶν εὐαγγελίων γραφῇ
φερομένων,)&mdash;<emph>he adopts the hypothesis that the text is genuine</emph>.
Καὶ δὴ τοῦδε τοῦ μέρους συγχωρουμένου εἶναι ἀληθοῦς, he
begins: and he enters at once without hesitation on an elaborate
<pb n="250"/><anchor id="Pg250"/>
discussion to shew <emph>how the two places may be
reconciled</emph>.<note place="foot">See above, pp. <ref target="Pg041">41</ref> to 51:
also <ref target="Appendix_B">Appendix (B)</ref>.</note>
What there is in this to countenance the notion that
in the opinion of Eusebius <q>the Gospel according to S. Mark
originally terminated at the 8th verse of the last chapter,</q>&mdash;I
profess myself unable to discover. I draw from his words
the precisely opposite inference. It is not even clear to me
that the Verses in dispute were absent from the copy which
Eusebius habitually employed. He certainly quotes one of
those verses once and again.<note place="foot">The reader is referred to Mai's
<hi rend='italic'>Nov. PP. Bibl.</hi> vol. iv. p. 262, line 12:
p. 264 line 28: p. 301, line 3-4, and 6-8.</note> On the other hand, the express
statement of Victor of Antioch [<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 450?] <emph>that he
knew of the mutilation, but had ascertained by Critical research
the genuineness of this Section of Scripture, and had adopted the
Text of the authentic <q>Palestinian</q> Copy</emph>,<note place="foot">See above, p.
<ref target="Pg064">64-5</ref>: also <ref target="Appendix_E">Appendix
(E)</ref>.</note>&mdash;is more than
enough to outweigh the faint presumption created (as some
might think) by the words of Eusebius, that his own copy
was without it. And yet, as already stated, there is nothing
whatever to shew that Eusebius himself deliberately rejected
the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel. Still less does
that Father anywhere say, or even hint, that in his judgment
the original Text of S. Mark was without them. If he
may be judged by his words, <emph>he accepted them as genuine</emph>: for
(what is at least certain) he argues upon their contents at
great length, and apparently without misgiving.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) It is high time however to point out that, after all,
the question to be decided is, not <emph>what Eusebius thought</emph> on
this subject, but what is historically probable. As a plain
matter of fact, the sum of the Patristic Evidence against
these Verses is the hypothetical suggestion of Eusebius
already quoted; which, (after a fashion well understood by
those who have given any attention to these studies), is observed
to have rapidly propagated itself in the congenial soil
of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century. And even if it could be
shewn that Eusebius deliberately <emph>rejected</emph> this portion of Scripture,
(which has never been done,)&mdash;yet, inasmuch as it may be regarded as
certain that those famous codices in the library of his friend
<pb n="251"/><anchor id="Pg251"/>
Pamphilus at Cæsarea, to which the ancients habitually referred,
<emph>recognised it as genuine</emph>,<note place="foot">P. <ref target="Pg068">68</ref>
and note (d); p. <ref target="Pg119">119</ref> and
note (m).</note>&mdash;the only sufferer from such
a conflict of evidence would surely be Eusebius himself: (not
<emph>S. Mark</emph>, I say, but <emph>Eusebius</emph>:) who is observed to employ an
incorrect text of Scripture on many other occasions; and
must (in such case) be held to have been unduly partial to
copies of S. Mark in the mutilated condition of Cod. B or
Cod. א. His words were translated by Jerome;<note place="foot">P.
<ref target="Pg051">51-7</ref>.</note> adopted by
Hesychius;<note place="foot">P. <ref target="Pg057">57-9</ref>.</note> referred to by
Victor;<note place="foot">P. <ref target="Pg059">59-66</ref>.</note> reproduced <q>with
a difference</q> in more than one ancient scholion.<note place="foot">P.
<ref target="Pg114">114-125</ref>.</note> But they are
found to have died away into a very faint echo when Euthymius
Zigabenus<note place="foot">P. <ref target="Pg068">68-9</ref>.</note> rehearsed them for
the last time in his Commentary on the Gospels, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 1116.
Exaggerated and misunderstood, behold them resuscitated after an interval of
seven centuries by Griesbach, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles
and the rest: again destined to fall into a congenial,
though very differently prepared soil; and again destined
(I venture to predict) to die out and soon to be forgotten
for ever.
</p>

<p>
(iv.) After all that has gone before, our two oldest Codices
(Cod. B and Cod. א) which alone witness to the truth of
Eusebius' testimony as to the state of certain copies of the
Gospels in his own day, need not detain us long. They are
thought to be as old as the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century: they are certainly without the concluding section of S. Mark's Gospel. But
it may not be forgotten that both Codices alike are disfigured
throughout by errors, interpolations and omissions
without number; that their testimony is continually divergent;
and that it often happens that where they both
agree they are both demonstrably in
error.<note place="foot"><ref target="Chapter_VI">Chap. VI</ref>.</note> Moreover, it is
a highly significant circumstance that the Vatican Codex
(B), which is the more ancient of the two, exhibits <emph>a vacant
column</emph> at the end of S. Mark's Gospel,&mdash;<emph>the only vacant column
in the whole codex</emph>: whereby it is shewn that the Copyist was
aware of the existence of the Twelve concluding Verses of
S. Mark's Gospel, even though he left them out:<note place="foot">See above, pp.
<ref target="Pg086">86</ref> to 88.</note> while the
<pb n="252"/><anchor id="Pg252"/>
original Scribe of the Codex Sinaiticus (א) is declared by
Tischendorf to have actually <emph>omitted the concluding verse of
S. John's Gospel</emph>,&mdash;in which unenviable peculiarity <emph>it stands
alone among MSS.</emph><note place="foot">Will it be believed that Tischendorf
accordingly rejects <emph>that</emph> verse also as
spurious; and brings the fourth Gospel to an end at ver. 24, as he brings the
second Gospel to an end at ver. 8? For my own part,&mdash;having (through the
kindness and liberality of the Keeper of the Imperial MSS. at S. Petersburg,
aided by the good offices of my friend, the Rev. A. S. Thompson, Chaplain at
S. Petersburg,) obtained a photograph of the last page of S. John's Gospel,&mdash;I
must be allowed altogether to call in question the accuracy of Dr. Tischendorf's
judgment in this particular. The utmost which can be allowed is that
the Scribe may have possibly changed his pen, or been called away from his
task, just before bringing the fourth Gospel to a close.</note>
</p>

<p>
(I.) And thus we are brought back to the point from
which we started. We are reminded that the one thing
to be accounted for is <emph>the mutilated condition of certain copies
of S. Mark's Gospel in the beginning of the fourth century</emph>;
of which, Cod. B and Cod. א are the two solitary surviving
specimens,&mdash;Eusebius, the one historical witness. We have
to decide, I mean, between the <emph>evidence</emph> for this
<emph>fact</emph>,&mdash;(namely, that within the first two centuries and a-half of
our æra, the Gospel according to S. Mark <emph>suffered mutilation</emph>;)&mdash;and the
<emph>reasonableness</emph> of the other <emph>opinion</emph>, namely, that S. Mark's
<emph>original autograph</emph> extended no farther than ch. xvi. 8. All
is reduced to this one issue; and unless any are prepared
to prove that the Twelve familiar Verses (ver. 9 to ver. 20)
with which S. Mark ends his Gospel <emph>cannot</emph> be his,&mdash;(I have
proved on the contrary that he must needs be thought to
have written them,<note place="foot">See <ref target="Chapter_IX">Chap.
IX</ref>.</note>)&mdash;I submit that it is simply irrational
to persist in asseverating that the reason why those verses
are not found in our two Codexes of the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century must be because they did not exist in the original autograph of
the Evangelist. What else is this but to set unsupported
<emph>opinion</emph>, or rather unreasoning <emph>prejudice</emph>, before the
<emph>historical evidence</emph> of a <emph>fact</emph>? The assumption is not only
gratuitous, arbitrary, groundless; but it is discountenanced by the evidence
of MSS., of Versions, of Fathers, (Versions and Fathers much older than the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century:) is rendered
in the highest degree improbable by every internal, every
<pb n="253"/><anchor id="Pg253"/>
external consideration: is condemned by <emph>the deliberate judgment
of the universal Church</emph>,&mdash;which, in its corporate capacity,
for eighteen hundred years, in all places, has not only
solemnly accepted the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel
as genuine, but has even singled them out for special
honour.<note place="foot"><ref target="Chapter_X">Chapter X</ref>.</note>
</p>

<p>
(II.) Let it be asked in conclusion,&mdash;(for this prolonged
discussion is now happily at an end,)&mdash;Are any inconveniences
likely to result from a frank and loyal admission,
(<emph>in the absence of any Evidence whatever to the contrary</emph>,) that
doubtless the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel are
just as worthy of acceptation as the rest? It might reasonably
be supposed, from the strenuous earnestness with which
the rejection of these Verses is generally advocated, that
some considerations must surely be assignable why the
opinion of their genuineness ought on no account to be
entertained. Do any such reasons exist? Are any inconveniences
whatever likely to supervene?
</p>

<p>
<emph>No</emph> reasons whatever are assignable, I reply; neither are
there <emph>any</emph> inconvenient consequences of any sort to be
anticipated,&mdash;except indeed to the Critics: to whom, it must be
confessed, the result proves damaging enough.
</p>

<p>
It will only follow,
</p>

<p>
(1st) That Cod. B and Cod. א must be henceforth allowed
to be <emph>in one more serious particular</emph> untrustworthy and erring
witnesses. They have been convicted, in fact, of bearing
false witness in respect of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, where their
evidence had been hitherto reckoned upon with the most
undoubting confidence.
</p>

<p>
(2ndly) That the critical statements of recent Editors,
and indeed the remarks of Critics generally, in respect of
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, will have to undergo serious revision:
in every important particular, will have to be unconditionally
withdrawn.
</p>

<p>
(3rdly) That, in all future critical editions of the New Testament,
these <q>Twelve Verses</q> will have to be restored to
their rightful honours: never more appearing disfigured
with brackets, encumbered with doubts, banished from their
<pb n="254"/><anchor id="Pg254"/>
context, or molested with notes of suspicion. On the contrary.
A few words of caution against the resuscitation
of what has been proved to be a <q>vulgar error,</q> will have
henceforth to be introduced <hi rend='italic'>in memoriam rei</hi>.
</p>

<p>
(4thly) Lastly, men must be no longer taught to look
with distrust on this precious part of the Deposit; and
encouraged to dispute the Divine sayings which it contains
on the plea that <emph>perhaps</emph> they may not be Divine, after all;
for that <emph>probably</emph> the entire section is not genuine. They
must be assured, on the contrary, that these Twelve Verses
are wholly undistinguishable in respect of genuineness from
the rest of the Gospel of S. Mark; and it may not be amiss
to remind them the Creed called the <q>Athanasian</q> speaks
no other language than that employed by the Divine Author
of our Religion and Object of our Faith. The Church warns
her children against the peril incurred by as many as wilfully
reject the Truth, in no other language but that of the
Great Head of the Church. No person may presume to
speak disparagingly of S. Mark xvi. 16, any more.
</p>

<p>
(III.) Whether,&mdash;after the foregoing exposure of a very
prevalent and highly popular, but at the same time most
calamitous misapprehension,&mdash;it will not become necessary
for Editors of the Text of the New Testament to reconsider
their conclusions in countless other places:&mdash;whether they
must not be required to review their method, and to remodel
their text throughout, now that they have been shewn the
insecurity of the foundation on which they have so confidently
builded, and been forced to reverse their verdict in
respect of a place of Scripture where at least they supposed
themselves impregnable;&mdash;I forbear at this time to inquire.
</p>

<p>
Enough to have demonstrated, as I claim to have now
done, that <emph>not a particle of doubt</emph>, that <emph>not an
atom of suspicion</emph>, attaches to <q><hi rend="smallcaps">the
last Twelve Verses of the
Gospel according to
S. Mark.</hi></q>

On the importance of attending to Patristic Citations of Scripture.&mdash;The
correct Text of <hi rend="smallcaps">S. Luke</hi> ii. 14, established.
</quote>

<p>
(Referred to at p. <ref target="Pg022">22</ref>.)
</p>

<p>
In <ref target="Chapter_III">Chapter III</ref>. the importance of attending to Patristic
citations of Scripture has been largely insisted upon. The
controverted reading of S. Luke ii. 14 supplies an apt illustration
of the position there maintained, viz. that this subject
has not hitherto engaged nearly as much attention as it
deserves.
</p>

<p>
I. Instead of ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία, (which is the reading
of the <q>Textus Receptus,</q>) Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles
and Alford present us with ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκίας. Their
authority for this reading is the consentient testimony of
<hi rend="smallcaps">the four oldest MSS. which contain</hi> S. Luke ii. 14 (viz.
B, א, A, D): <hi rend="smallcaps">the Latin Versions</hi> generally
(<q><hi rend='italic'>in hominibus bonae voluntatis</hi></q>); and
<hi rend="smallcaps">the Gothic</hi>. Against these are
to be set, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cod.</hi> A (in the Hymn at the end of the Psalms);
<hi rend="smallcaps">all the other Uncials</hi>; together <hi rend="smallcaps">with
every known cursive MS.</hi>; and <hi rend="smallcaps">every other ancient Version</hi>
in existence.
</p>

<p>
So far, the evidence of mere Antiquity may be supposed
to preponderate in favour of εὐδοκίας: though no judicious
Critic, it is thought, should hesitate in deciding in favour
of εὐδοκία, even upon the evidence already adduced. The
advocates of the popular Theory ask,&mdash;But <emph>why</emph> should the
four oldest MSS., together with the Latin and the Gothic
Versions, conspire in reading εὐδοκίας, if εὐδοκία be right?
That question shall be resolved by-and-by. Let them in
the mean time tell us, if they can,&mdash;How is it credible that,
in such a matter as this, <emph>every other MS. and every other
Version in the world</emph> should read εὐδοκία, if εὐδοκία be wrong?
But the evidence of Antiquity has not yet been nearly cited.
I proceed to set it forth in detail.

<p>
Now, when it is considered that these seventeen Fathers
of the Church<note place="foot">Pseudo-Gregory Thaumaturgus, Pseudo-Basil, Patricius,
and Marius Mercator, are designedly omitted in this enumeration.</note> all concur
in exhibiting the Angelic Hymn <emph>as our own Textus Receptus exhibits
it</emph>,&mdash;(viz. ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία,)&mdash;<emph>who</emph> does not see
that the four oldest uncial authorities
<pb n="259"/><anchor id="Pg259"/>
for εὐδοκίας are hopelessly outvoted by authorities
yet older than themselves? Here is, to all intents and
purposes, a record of what was once found in <emph>two Codices of
the iii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> century</emph>; in <emph>nine of the
iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi></emph>; in <emph>three of the
v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi></emph>;&mdash;added to the testimony of the
two Syriac, the Egyptian, the Ethiopic, and the Armenian versions. In this instance
therefore the evidence of Antiquity is even overwhelming.
</p>

<p>
Most decisive of all, perhaps, is the fact this was the form
in which <emph>the Churches of the East</emph> preserved the Angelic
Hymn in their private, as well as their solemn public Devotions.
Take it, from a document of the v<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ΔΟΞΑ ΕΝ ΥΨΙΣΤΟΙΣ ΘΕΩ<lb/>
ΚΑΙ ΕΠΙ ΓΗΣ ΕΙΡΗΝΗ<lb/>
ΕΝ ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΙΣ ΕΥΔΟΚΙΑ.<note place="foot">Codex A,&mdash;ὕμνος ἑωθινός at the end of
the Psalms.</note>
</p>

<p>
But the text of this Hymn, as a Liturgical document,
at a yet earlier period is unequivocally established by the
combined testimony of the Apostolical Constitutions (already
quoted,) and of Chrysostom, who says expressly:&mdash;Εὐχαριστοῦντες
λέγομεν, Δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις Θεῷ, καὶ ἐπὶ γῆς εἰρήνη,
ἐν ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία. [<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> xi. 347
<hi rend="smallcaps">B</hi>.] Now this incontestably
proves that <emph>the Church's established way of reciting the
Angelic Hymn in the iv<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century</emph> was in
conformity with the reading of the Textus Receptus. And this fact infinitely
outweighs the evidence of any extant MSS. which can be
named: for it is the consentient evidence of hundreds,&mdash;or
rather of thousands of copies of the Gospels of a date anterior
to <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 400, which have long since perished.
</p>

<p>
To insist upon this, however, is not at all my present
purpose. About the true reading of S. Luke ii. 14,
(which is <emph>not</emph> the reading of Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles,
Alford,) there is clearly no longer any room for
doubt. It is perhaps one of the best established readings in
the whole compass of the New Testament. My sole object is
to call attention to the two following facts:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1) That <emph>the four oldest Codices which contain S. Luke</emph> ii. 14
(B, א, A, D, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 320-520), and two of the oldest Versions,
conspire in exhibiting the Angelic Hymn <emph>incorrectly</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(2) That we are indebted to <emph>fourteen of the Fathers</emph>
(<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi>
<pb n="260"/><anchor id="Pg260"/>
240-434), and to the rest of the ancient Versions, for the
true reading of that memorable place of Scripture.
</p>

<p>
II. Against all this, it is urged (by Tischendorf) that,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
1. <hi rend="smallcaps">Irenæus</hi> sides with the oldest uncials.&mdash;Now, the Greek
of the place referred to is lost. A Latin translation is all that
survives. According to <emph>that</emph> evidence, Irenæus, having quoted
the place in conformity with the Vulgate reading (iii. c. x.
§ 41,&mdash;<q><hi rend='italic'>Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae
voluntatis</hi>,</q>) presently adds,&mdash;<q>In eo quod dicunt,
<hi rend='italic'>Gloria in altissimis <hi rend="smallcaps">Deo</hi> et in terra
pax</hi>, eum qui sit altissimorum, hoc
est, supercaelestium factor et eorum, quae super terram
omnium conditor, his sermonibus glorificaverunt; qui suo
plasmati, hoc est hominibus suam benignitatem salutis de
caelo misit.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi> Stieren, i. 459).&mdash;But it must suffice
to point out (1) that these words really prove nothing: and
(2) that it would be very unsafe to build upon them, even if
they did; since (3) it is plain that the Latin translator exhibits
the place in the Latin form most familiar to himself:
(consider his substitution of <q>excelsis</q> for <q>altissimis.</q>)
</p>

<p>
2. Next, <hi rend="smallcaps">Origen</hi> is claimed on the same side, on the
strength of the following passage in (Jerome's version of)
his lost Homilies on S. Luke:&mdash;<q>Si scriptum esset, <emph>Super
terram pax</emph>, et hucusque esset finita sententia, recte quaestio
nasceretur. Nunc vero in eo quod additum est, hoc est,
quod post pacem dicitur, <emph>In hominibus bonae voluntatis</emph>, solvit
quaestionem. Pax enim quam non dat Dominus super
terram, non est pax bonae voluntatis.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. p. 946.)
<q>From this,</q> (says Tischendorf, who is followed by Tregelles,)
<q>it is plain that Origen regarded εὐδοκίας as the
true reading; not εὐδοκία&mdash;which is now thrice found in his
Greek writings.</q>&mdash;But,
</p>

<p>
Is one here more struck with the unfairness of the Critic,
or with the feebleness of his reasoning? For,&mdash;(to say nothing
of the insecurity of building on a Latin Translation,<note place="foot">The old Latin
Interpreter of Origen's Commentary on S. Matthew seems to have found in Origen's text
a quotation from S. Luke ii. 14 which is <emph>not represented in the extant Greek
text of Origen</emph>. Here also we are presented with <q>hominibus <emph>bonae
voluntatis</emph>.</q> (<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> iii. 537
<hi rend="smallcaps">C</hi>). We can say nothing to such second-hand evidence.</note>
<pb n="261"/><anchor id="Pg261"/>
especially in such a matter as the present,)&mdash;How can testimony
like this be considered to outweigh the three distinct
places in the original writings of this Father, where he
reads not εὐδοκίας but εὐδοκία? Again. Why is a doubt
insinuated concerning the trustworthiness of those three
places, (<q>ut <emph>nunc</emph> reperitur,</q>) where there really is
<emph>no</emph> doubt? How is Truth ever to be attained if investigations like the
present are to be conducted in the spirit of an eager partisan,
instead of with the calm gravity of an impartial
judge?
</p>

<p>
But I may as well state plainly that the context of the
passage above quoted shews that Tischendorf's proposed inference
is inadmissible. Origen is supposing some one to
ask the following question:&mdash;<q>Since Angels on the night
when <hi rend="smallcaps">Christ</hi> was born proclaimed <q>on earth
<emph>Peace</emph>,</q>&mdash;why does our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> say,
<q>I am <emph>not</emph> come to send Peace upon
earth, but a sword?</q>... Consider,</q> (he proceeds) <q>whether
the answer may not be this:</q>&mdash;and then comes the
extract given above. Origen, (to express oneself with colloquial
truthfulness,) is <emph>at his old tricks</emph>. He is evidently acquainted
with the reading εὐδοκίας: and because it enables
him to offer (what appears to him) an ingenious solution of
a certain problem, he adopts it for the nonce: his proposal
to take the words εἰρήνη εὐδοκίας together, being simply
preposterous,&mdash;as no one ever knew better than Origen
himself.<note place="foot">Consider his exactly similar method concerning Eph. i. 1.
(<hi rend='italic'>Suprà</hi>, pp. <ref target="Pg096">96-99</ref>.)</note>
</p>

<p>
3. Lastly, <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyril of Jerusalem</hi> is invariably cited by the
latest Critics as favouring the reading εὐδοκίας. Those
learned persons have evidently overlooked the candid acknowledgment
of De Touttée, Cyril's editor, (p. 180, cf.
bottom of p. 102,) that though <emph>the MSS. of Cyril</emph> exhibit
εὐδοκία, yet in his editorial capacity he had ventured <emph>to print</emph>
εὐδοκίας. This therefore is one more Patristic attestation
to the trustworthiness of the Textus Receptus in respect of
S. Luke ii. 14, which has been hitherto unaccountably lost
sight of by Critics. (May I, without offence, remind Editors
of Scripture that instead of <emph>copying</emph>, they ought in every instance
<emph>to verify</emph> their references?)
</p>

<pb n="262"/><anchor id="Pg262"/>

<p>
III. The history of this corruption of the Text is not hard
to discover. It is interesting and instructive also.
</p>

<p>
(1.) In the immediately post-Apostolic age,&mdash;if not earlier
still,&mdash;some Copyist will have omitted the ἐν before ἀνθρώποις.
The resemblance of the letters and the similarity
of the sound (ΕΝ, ΑΝ,) misled him:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
ΕΝΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΙΣ
</p>

<p>
Every one must see at a glance how easily the thing may
have happened. (It is in fact precisely what <emph>has</emph> happened
in Acts iv. 12; where, for ἐν ἀνθρώποις, D and a few cursive
MSS. read ἀνθρώποις,&mdash;being countenanced therein by
the Latin Versions generally, and by them only.)
</p>

<p>
(2.) The result however&mdash;(δόξα ἐν ὑψίστοις Θεῷ καὶ
ἐπὶ γῆς εἰρήνη ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκία)&mdash;was obviously an impossible
sentence. It could not be allowed to stand. And yet
it was not by any means clear what had happened to it. In
order, as it seems, to <emph>force</emph> a meaning into the words, some
one with the best intentions will have put the sign of the
genitive (Σ) at the end of εὐδοκία. The copy so depraved
was destined to play an important part; for it became the
fontal source of the Latin Version, which exhibits the place
thus:&mdash;<hi rend='italic'>Gloria in altissimis <hi rend="smallcaps">Deo</hi>, et in
terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis....</hi> It is evident, by the way, (if the
quotation from Irenæus, given above, is to be depended upon,)
that Irenæus must have so read the place: (viz. εἰρήνη
ἀνθρώποις εὐδοκίας.)
</p>

<p>
(3.) To restore the preposition (ΕΝ) which had been accidentally
thrust out, and to obliterate the sign of the genitive
(Σ) which had been without authority thrust in, was an
obvious proceeding. Accordingly, <emph>every Greek Evangelium
extant</emph> exhibits ἐν ἀνθρώποις: while <emph>all but four</emph> (B, א, A, D)
read εὐδοκία. In like manner, into some MSS. of the Vulgate
(e.g. the <hi rend='italic'>Cod. Amiatinus</hi>,) the preposition (<q>in</q>) has
found its way back; but the genitive (<q>bonae voluntatis</q>)
has never been rectified in a single copy of the Latin version.&mdash;The
Gothic represents a copy which exhibited ἐν ἀνθρώποις
εὐδοκίας.<note place="foot">From the Rev. Professor Bosworth.</note>
</p>

<pb n="263"/><anchor id="Pg263"/>

<p>
The consequence is that a well-nigh untranslatable expression
retains its place in the Vulgate to the present hour.
Whether (with Origen) we connect εὐδοκίας with εἰρήνη,&mdash;or
(with the moderns) we propose to understand <q>men of good
pleasure,</q>&mdash;the result is still the same. The harmony of
the three-part Anthem which the Angels sang on the night
of the Nativity is hopelessly marred, and an unintelligible
discord substituted in its place. Logic, Divinity, Documents
are here all at one. The reading of Stephens is unquestionably
correct. The reading of the latest Editors is as certainly
corrupt. This is a case therefore where the value of
Patristic testimony becomes strikingly apparent. It affords
also one more crucial proof of the essential hollowness
of the theory on which it has been recently proposed by
Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles and the rest to reconstruct
the text of the New Testament.
</p>

<p>
To some, it may perhaps seem unreasonable that so many
words should be devoted to the establishment of the text of
a single place of Scripture,&mdash;depending, as that text does,
on the insertion or the omission of a single letter. I am
content to ask in reply,&mdash;<emph>What</emph> is important, if not the
utterance of Heaven, when, at the laying of the corner-stone
of the New Creation, <q>the Morning Stars sang together,
and all the Sons of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi> shouted for joy?</q>
</p>

<p>
IV. Only one word in conclusion.
</p>

<p>
Whenever the time comes for the Church of England to
revise her Authorized Version (1611), it will become necessary
that she should in the first instance instruct some of the
more judicious and learned of her sons carefully to revise
the Greek Text of Stephens (1550). Men require to know
precisely what it is they have to translate before they can
pretend to translate it. As for supposing that Scholars who
have been appointed to revise <emph>a Translation</emph> are competent at
a moment's notice, as every fresh difficulty presents itself, to
develop the skill requisite for revising <emph>the original Text</emph>,&mdash;it
is clearly nothing else but supposing that experts in
one Science can at pleasure shew themselves proficients in
another.
</p>

<p>
But it so happens that, on the present occasion, that <emph>other</emph>
<pb n="264"/><anchor id="Pg264"/>
Science is one of exceeding difficulty. Revisionists <emph>here</emph>
will find it necessary altogether to disabuse their minds of
the <emph>Theory</emph> of Textual Criticism which is at present the dominant
and the popular one,&mdash;and of which I have made
it my business to expose the fallaciousness, in respect of
several crucial texts, in the course of the present work.
</p>

<p>
I cannot so far forget the unhappy circumstances of the
times as to close this note without the further suggestion,
(sure therein of the approval of our trans-Atlantic brethren,)
that, for a Revision of the Authorized Version to enjoy the
confidence of the Nation, and to procure for itself acceptance
at the hands of the Church,&mdash;it will be found necessary
that the work should be confided to <emph>Churchmen</emph>. The
Church may never abdicate her function of being <q>a Witness
and a Keeper of Holy Writ.</q> Neither can she, without
flagrant inconsistency and scandalous consequence, ally
herself in the work of Revision with the Sects. Least of all
may she associate with herself in the sacred undertaking
an Unitarian Teacher,&mdash;one who avowedly [see the letter
of <q>One of the Revisionists, G. V. S.,</q> in the <q>Times</q> of
July 11, 1870] denies the eternal <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>head of her
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.
That the individual alluded to has shewn any peculiar aptitude
for the work of a Revisionist; or that he is a famous
Scholar; or that he can boast of acquaintance with any of
the less familiar departments of Sacred Learning; is not
even pretended. (It would matter nothing if the reverse
were the case.) What else, then, is this but to offer a deliberate
insult to the Majesty of Heaven in the Divine Person
of Him who is alike the Object of the Everlasting Gospel,
and its Author?

Proof that <hi rend="smallcaps">Hesychius</hi> is a copyist only in what he says

§ 1. It was confidently stated above (at p. <ref target="Pg058">58</ref>) that
<hi rend="smallcaps">Hesychius</hi>,
discussing the consistency of S. Matthew's ὀψὲ τῶν
σαββάτων (chap. xxviii. 1), with the πρωί of S. Mark (chap.
xvi. 9), is a <emph>copyist</emph> only; and that he copies from the
<q>Quaestiones ad Marinum</q> of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>. The proof of that
statement is subjoined. It should perhaps be explained that
the extracts in the right-hand column have been dislocated
in order to shew their close resemblance to what is set down

Some account of <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch's</hi> Commentary on S. Mark's

Victor's Work.

<p>
(Referred to at p. <ref target="Pg060">60</ref>.)

<p>
<q>Après avoir examiné avec soin les MSS. de la Bibliothèque
du Roi,</q> (says the Père Simon in his <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Crit.
du N. T.</hi> p. 79,) <q>j'ai réconnu que cet ouvrage</q> (he is
speaking of the Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel popularly
ascribed to Victor of Antioch,) <q>n'est ni d'Origéne, ni de
Victor d'Antioche, ni de Cyrille, ni d'aucun autre auteur en
particulier. C'est un recueil de plusieurs Pères, dont on a
marqué les noms dans quelques exemplaires; et si ces noms
ne se trouvent point dans d'autres, cela est assez ordinaire
à ces recueils, qu'on appelle <emph>chaînes</emph>.</q><note place="foot">Kollar,
(editing Lambecius,&mdash;iii. 159, 114,) expresses the same opinion.&mdash;Huet
(<hi rend='italic'>Origeniana</hi>, lib. iii. c. 4, pp. 274-5,) has a brief and
unsatisfactory dissertation on the same subject; but he arrives at a far shrewder
conclusion.</note> It will be seen from
the notices of the work in question already offered, (<hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>,
p. <ref target="Pg059">59</ref> to p. 65,) that I am able to yield only a limited
acquiescence in this learned writer's verdict. That the materials
out of which <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch</hi> constructed his Commentary
are scarcely ever original,&mdash;is what no one will deny who
examines the work with attention. But the Author of
a compilation is an Author still; and to put Victor's claim
to the work before us on a level with that of Origen or of
Cyril, is entirely to misrepresent the case and hopelessly to
perplex the question.
</p>

<p>
Concerning <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi> himself, nothing whatever is known
except that he was <q>a presbyter of Antioch.</q> Concerning
his Work, I will not here repeat what I have already stated
elsewhere; but, requesting the Reader to refer to what was
remarked at pp. <ref target="Pg059">59</ref> to 65, I propose to offer a few observations
with which I was unwilling before to encumber the
<pb n="270"/><anchor id="Pg270"/>
text; holding it to be a species of duty for those who have
given any time and attention to a subject like the present to
contribute the result, (however slender and unsatisfactory it
may prove,) to the common store. Let abler men enlarge
the ensuing scanty notices, and correct me if in any respect
I shall have inadvertently fallen into error.
</p>

<p>
1. There exists a Commentary, then, on S. Mark's Gospel,
which generally claims on its front <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Victor, Presbyter
of Antioch</hi>,</q> for its Author.<note place="foot">The copies which I have seen,
are headed,&mdash;ΒΙΚΤΟΡΟΣ (sometimes ΒΙΚΤΩΡΟΣ) ΠΡΕΣΒΥΤΕΡΟΥ ΑΝΤΙΟΧΕΙΑΣ ΕΡΜΗΝΕΙΑ ΕΙΣ

2. The Greek text of Victor was first published at Rome
by Peter Possinus in 1673, from a MS. existing somewhere
in Germany; which Bathazar Corderius had transcribed and
presented to Possinus about thirty years before. Corderius
gave Possinus at the same time his transcript of an anonymous
Commentary on S. Mark preserved in the Vatican;
and Possinus had already in his possession the transcript of
a third Commentary on the same Evangelist (also anonymous)
which he had obtained from the Library of Charles
de Montchal, Abp. of Toulouse. These three transcripts Possinus
published in a well-known volume. It is to be wished
that he had kept them distinct, instead of to some extent
blending their contents confusedly into one.<note place="foot"><q>Ex hoc ego, quasi

</p>

<p>
3. At the end of another century, (1775) C. F. Matthaei
put forth at Moscow, with his usual skill and accuracy,
a new and independent Edition of Victor's Commentary:<note place="foot">ΒΙΚΤΩΡΟΣ
πρεσβυτέρου Ἀντιοχείας καὶ ἄλλων τινῶν ἁγίων πατέρων ἐξήσησις εἰς τὸ κατὰ Μάρκον
ἅγιον εὐαγγέλιον: ex Codd. Mosqq. edidit C. F. Matthæi,
Mosquae, 1775.</note>
the text of which is based on four of the Moscow MSS.
This work, which appeared in two parts, has become of
extraordinary rarity. I have only just ascertained (June,
1871,) that one entire Copy is preserved in this country.
</p>

<p>
4. Lastly, (in 1840,) Dr. J. A. Cramer, in the first volume
of his <hi rend='italic'>Catenae</hi> on the N. T., reproduced Victor's work from
independent MS. sources. He took for his basis two Codices
in the Paris Library, (No. 186 and No. 188), which, however,
prove to have been anciently so exactly assimilated the one to
the other [<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, p. <ref target="Pg279">279</ref>] as to be,
in fact, but duplicates of one and the same original. Cramer supplemented their contents
from Laud. Gr. 33, (in the Bodleian:) Coisl. 23: and Reg.
178 at Paris. The result has been by far the fullest and
most satisfactory exhibition of the Commentary of Victor of
Antioch which has hitherto appeared. Only is it to be
regretted that the work should have been suffered to come
abroad disfigured in every page with errors so gross as to be
even scandalous, and with traces of slovenly editorship which
are simply unintelligible. I cannot bring myself to believe
that Dr. Cramer ever inspected the MSS. in the Paris
Library in person. Else would the slender advantage which
those abundant materials have proved to so learned and accomplished
a scholar, be altogether unaccountable. Moreover,
he is incorrect in what he says about them:<note place="foot">P. xxvii-xxviii.</note>
while his reasons for proposing to assign the work of Victor
of Antioch to Cyril of Alexandria are undeserving of serious
attention.
</p>

<p>
On a comparison of these four Editions of the same work,
it is discovered that the Latin version of Peltanus (1580),
<pb n="272"/><anchor id="Pg272"/>
<emph>represents the same Greek text</emph> which Possinus gave to the
world in 1673. Peltanus translates very loosely; in fact
he paraphrases rather than translates his author, and confesses
that he has taken great liberties with Victor's text.
But I believe it will be found that there can have been no
considerable discrepancy between the MS. which Peltanus
employed, and that which Possinus afterwards published.&mdash;Not
so the text which Matthaei edited, which is in fact for
the most part, (though not invariably,) rather an Epitome
of Victor's Commentary. On the other hand, Cramer's
text is more full than that of Possinus. There seem to be
only a few lines in Possinus, here and there, which are not
to be met with in Cramer; whereas no less than twenty-eight
of Cramer's pages are not found in the work of Possinus.
Cramer's edition, therefore, is by far the most complete
which has hitherto appeared. And though it cries aloud
for revision throughout; though many important corrections
might easily be introduced into it, and the whole
brought back in countless particulars more nearly to the
state in which it is plain that Victor originally left it;&mdash;I
question whether more than a few pages of <emph>additional
matter</emph> could easily be anywhere recovered. I collated several
pages of Cramer (Oct. 1869) with every MS. of Victor in
the Paris Library; and all but invariably found that Cramer's
text was fuller than that of the MS. which lay before
me. Seldom indeed did I meet with a few lines in any
MS. which had not already seen the light in Cramer's edition.
One or other of the four Codices which he employed
seems to fill up almost every hiatus which is met with in
any of the MSS. of this Father.
</p>

<p>
For it must be stated, once for all, that an immense, and
I must add, a most unaccountable discrepancy is observable
between the several extant copies of Victor: yet not so
much in respect of various readings, or serious modifications
of his text; (though the transpositions are very frequent,
and often very mischievous;<note place="foot">To understand what is alluded to, the
reader should compare the upper and the lower half of p. 442 in Cramer: noting that
he has one and the same annotation before him; but diversely exhibited. (The lower
part of the page is taken from Cod. 178.) Besides transposing the sentences, the
author of Cod. 178 has suppressed the reference to Chrysostom, and omitted the name
of Apolinarius in line 10. (Compare Field's ed. of <hi rend='italic'>Chrys.</hi>
iii. 529, top of the page.)</note>) as resulting from the boundless
<pb n="273"/><anchor id="Pg273"/>
license which every fresh copyist seems to have allowed
himself chiefly in <emph>abridging</emph> his author.&mdash;To skip a few lines:
to omit an explanatory paragraph, quotation, or digression:
to pass <hi rend='italic'>per saltum</hi> from the beginning to the end of a passage:
sometimes to leave out a whole page: to transpose:
to paraphrase: to begin or to end with quite a different
form of words;&mdash;proves to have been the rule. Two copyists
engaged on the same portion of Commentary are observed
to abridge it in two quite different ways. I question whether
there exist in Europe three manuscripts of Victor
which correspond entirely throughout. The result is perplexing
in a high degree. Not unfrequently (as might be
expected) we are presented with two or even three different
exhibitions of one and the same annotation.<note place="foot">Thus the two notes on
p. 440 are found substantially to agree with the note on p. 441, which = Chrys. p.
527. See also <hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, p. <ref target="Pg289">289</ref>.</note>
Meanwhile, as if to render the work of collation (in a manner) impossible,&mdash;(1)
Peltanus pleads guilty to having transposed
and otherwise taken liberties with the text he translated:
(2) Possinus confessedly welded three codices into one:
(3) Matthaei pieced and patched his edition out of four
MSS.; and (4) Cramer, out of five.
</p>

<p>
The only excuse I can invent for this strange licentiousness
on the part of Victor's ancient transcribers is this:&mdash;They
must have known perfectly well, (in fact it is obvious,)
that the work before them was really little else but
a compilation; and that Victor had already abridged in the
same merciless way the writings of the Fathers (Chrysostom
chiefly) from whom he obtained his materials. We
are to remember also, I suppose, the labour which transcription
involved, and the costliness of the skins out of
which ancient books were manufactured. But when all
has been said, I must candidly admit that the extent of
license which the ancients evidently allowed themselves
quite perplexes me.<note place="foot">Let any one, with Mai's edition of the
<q>Quaestiones ad Marinum</q> of Eusebius before him, note how mercilessly they are
abridged, mutilated, amputated by subsequent writers. Compare for instance p. 257
with Cramer's <q>Catenae,</q> i. p. 251-2; and this again with the <q>Catena in
Joannem</q> of Corderius, p. 448-9.</note> <emph>Why</emph>, for example, remodel the
structure
<pb n="274"/><anchor id="Pg274"/>
of a sentence and needlessly vary its phraseology?
Never I think in my life have I been more hopelessly confused
than in the <hi rend='italic'>Bibliothèque</hi>, while attempting to collate
certain copies of Victor of Antioch.
</p>

<p>
I dismiss this feature of the case by saying that if any
person desires a sample of the process I have been describing,
he cannot do better than bestow a little attention on
the <q>Preface</q> (ὑπόθεσις) at the beginning of Victor's Commentary.
It consists of thirty-eight lines in Cramer's
edition: of which Possinus omits eleven; and Matthaei
also, eleven;&mdash;<emph>but not the same eleven</emph>. On the other hand,
Matthaei<note place="foot">With whom, Reg. 177 and 703 agree.</note>
<emph>prolongs</emph> the Preface by eight lines. Strange to
relate, the MS. from which Cramer professes to publish, goes
on differently. If I may depend on my hasty pencilling,
after ἐκκλησίαις [<hi rend='italic'>Cramer</hi>, i. p. 264, line 16,] Evan. 300,
[ = Reg. 186, <hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 93, line 16 from bottom] proceeds,&mdash;Κλήμης
ἐν ἕκτῳ τῶν ὑποτυπώσεων, (thirty-one lines, ending)
χαρακτήρ ἐγένετο.
</p>

<p>
On referring to the work of Possinus, <q>Anonymus Vaticanus</q>
is found to exhibit so admirable a condensation (?)
of the ὑπόθεσις in question, that it is difficult to divest oneself
of the suspicion that it must needs be an original and
independent composition; the germ out of which the longer
Preface has grown.... We inspect the first few pages of
the Commentary, and nothing but perplexity awaits us at
every step. It is not till we have turned over a few pages
that we begin to find something like exact correspondence.
</p>

<p>
As for the Work,&mdash;(for I must now divest myself of the
perplexing recollections which the hurried collation of so
many MSS. left behind; and plainly state that, in spite of
all, I yet distinctly ascertained, and am fully persuaded
that the original work was <emph>one</emph>,&mdash;the production, no doubt,
of <q>Victor, Presbyter of Antioch,</q> as 19 out of the 52
MSS. declare):&mdash;For the Commentary itself, I say, Victor
explains at the outset what his method had been. Having
<pb n="275"/><anchor id="Pg275"/>
failed to discover any separate exposition of S. Mark's Gospel,
he had determined to construct one, by collecting the
occasional notices scattered up and down the writings of
Fathers of the Church.<note place="foot">p. 263, line 3 to 13, and in Possinus, p.
4.</note> Accordingly, he presents us in
the first few lines of his Commentary (p. 266) with a brief
quotation from the work of Eusebius <q>to Marinus, on the
seeming inconsistency of the Evangelical accounts of the
Resurrection;</q> following it up with a passage from <q>the
vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
[vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>?]
tome of Origen's Exegetics on S. John's Gospel.</q>
We are thus presented at the outset with <emph>two</emph> of Victor's
favorite authorities. The work of Eusebius just named he
was evidently thoroughly familiar with.<note place="foot">Eusebius is again quoted at
p. 444, and referred to at p. 445 (line 23-5). See especially p. 446.</note>
I suspect that he has many an unsuspected quotation from its pages. Towards
the end of his Commentary, (as already elsewhere explained,)
he quotes it once and again.
</p>

<p>
Of Origen also Victor was evidently very fond<note place="foot">What is found at p.
314 (on S. Mark v. 1,) is a famous place. (Cf. Huet's ed. ii. 131.) Compare also
Victor's first note on i. 7 with the same edit. of Origen, ii. 125
<hi rend="smallcaps">c, d</hi>,&mdash;which Victor is found to have abridged. Compare
the last note on p. 346 with Orig. i. 284 <hi rend="smallcaps">a</hi>. Note, that
ἄλλος δέ φησι, (foot of p. 427) is also Origen. Cf. Possinus, p. 324.</note>: and his
words on two or three occasions seem to shew that he had
recourse besides habitually to the exegetical labours of Apolinarius,
Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Titus of Bostra.<note place="foot">See pp. 408, 418,
442.</note> Passages from Cyril of Alexandria are occasionally met
with;<note place="foot">e.g. the first note on p. 311; (comp. Possinus, p. 95): and the
last note on p. 323; (comp. Poss. p. 123.) Compare also Cramer, p. 395 (line 16-22)
with Poss. p. 249.&mdash;I observe that part of a note on p. 315 is ascribed by Possinus
(p. 102) to Athanasius: while a scholium at p. 321 and p. 359, has no
owner.</note> and once at least (p. 370) he has an extract from Basil.
The historian Josephus he sometimes refers to by name.<note place="foot">e.g. p. 408,
411 (twice).</note>
</p>

<p>
But the Father to whom Victor is chiefly indebted is
Chrysostom,&mdash;whom he styles <q>the blessed John, Bishop of
the Royal City;</q> (meaning Constantinople<note place="foot">In p. 418,&mdash;ὁ τῆς
βασιλίδος πόλεως ἐπίσκοπος Ἰωάννης. For instances of quotation from Chrysostom, comp.
V. A. p. 315 with Chrys. pp. 398-9: p. 376 with Chrys. pp. 227-8: p. 420 with Chrys.
p. 447, &amp;c.</note>). Not that
<pb n="276"/><anchor id="Pg276"/>
Victor, strictly speaking, <emph>transcribes</emph> from Chrysostom; at
least, to any extent. His general practice is slightly to
adapt his Author's language to his own purpose; sometimes,
to leave out a few words; a paragraph; half a page.<note place="foot">Take for example
Victor's Commentary on the stilling of the storm (pp. 312-3), which is merely an
abridged version of the first part of Chrysostom's
28<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Homily on S. Matthew (pp. 395-8); about
45 lines being left out. Observe Victor's method however. Chrysostom begins as
follows:&mdash;Ὁ μὲν οὖν Λουκᾶς, ἀπαλλάττων ἑαυτὸν τοῦ ἀπαιτηθῆναι τῶν χρόνων τὴν τάξιν,
οὕτως εἶπεν. (Then follows S. Luke viii. 22.) καὶ ὁ Μάρκος ὁμοίως. Οὗτος δὲ οὐχ
οὕτως; ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκολουθίαν ἐνταῦθα διατηρεῖ. Victor, because he had S. Mark
(not S. Matthew) to comment upon, begins thus:&mdash;Ὁ μὲν Μάρκος ἀπαλλάττων
ἑαυτὸν τοῦ ἀπαιτηθῆναι τῶν χρόνων τὴν τάξιν, οὕτως εἶπεν, ὁμοίως δὲ καὶ ὁ Λοῦκας;
ὁ δὲ Ματθαῖος οὐχ οὕτως; ἀλλὰ καὶ ἀκολουθίαν ἐνταῦθα διατηρεῖ.</note> Then,
he proceeds to quote another Father probably; or, it may
be, to offer something of his own. But he seldom gives any
intimation of what it is he does: and if it were not for the
occasional introduction of the phrase ὁ μέν φησι or ἄλλος δέ
φησι,<note place="foot">e.g. V. A. p. 422 (from ὁ μέν φησιν to ἄλλος δέ φησιν) = Chrys.
p. 460. Observe the next paragraph also, (p. 423,) begins, ἄλλος φησιν.&mdash;So again,
V. A. pp. 426-7 = Chrys. pp. 473-6: where ἄλλος δέ φησι, at the foot of p. 427
introduces a quotation from Origen, as appears from Possinus, p. 324&mdash;See
also p. 209, line 1,&mdash;which is from Chrys. p. 130,&mdash;ἤ ὡς ὁ ἄλλος being the next
words.&mdash;The first three lines in p. 316 = Chrys. p. 399. Then follows, ἄλλος δέ
φησιν. See also pp. 392: 407 (φασί τινες&mdash;ἕτερος δέ φησιν): pp. 415 and 433.
After quoting Eusebius by name (p. 446-7), Victor says (line 3) ἅλλος δέ
φησιν.</note> a reader of Victor's Commentary might almost mistake
it for an original composition. So little pains does this
Author take to let his reader know when he is speaking in
his own person, when not, that he has not scrupled to retain
Chrysostom's phrases ἐγὼ δὲ οἶμαι,<note place="foot">e.g. V. A. p. 420 line 15, which
= Chrys. p. 447.</note> &amp;c. The result is that
it is often impossible to know to <emph>whose</emph> sentiments we are
listening. It cannot be too clearly borne in mind that
ancient ideas concerning authorship differed entirely from
those of modern times; especially when Holy Scripture was
to be commented on.
</p>

<p>
I suspect that, occasionally, copyists of Victor's work,
as they recognised a fragment here and there, prefixed to it
<pb n="277"/><anchor id="Pg277"/>
the name of its author. This would account for the extremely
partial and irregular occurrence of such notes of
authorship; as well as explain why a name duly prefixed
in one copy is often missing in another.<note place="foot">e.g. Theod. Mops., (p.
414,) which name is absent from Cod. Reg. 201:&mdash;Basil, (p. 370) whose name
Possinus does not seem to have read:&mdash;Cyril's name, which Possinus found in
a certain place (p. 311), is not mentioned in <hi rend='italic'>Laud.</hi>
Gr. 33 <hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 100 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>, at top, &amp;c.</note>
Whether Victor's Commentary can in strictness be called a <q>Catena,</q> or not,
must remain uncertain until some one is found willing to
undertake the labour of re-editing his pages; from which,
by the way, I cannot but think that some highly interesting
(if not some important) results would follow.
</p>

<p>
Yet, inasmuch as Victor never, or certainly very seldom,
prefixes to a passage from a Father <emph>the name of its Author</emph>;&mdash;above
all, seeing that sometimes, at all events, he is original,
or at least speaks in his own person;&mdash;I think the
title of <q>Catena</q> inappropriate to his Commentary.
</p>

<p>
As favourable and as interesting a specimen of this work
as could be found, is supplied by his annotation on S. Mark
xiv. 3. He begins as follows, (quoting Chrysostom, p. 436):&mdash;<q>One
and the same woman seems to be spoken of by all
the Evangelists. Yet is this not the case. By three of
them one and the same seems to be spoken of; not however
by S. John, but another famous person,&mdash;the sister of Lazarus.
This is what is said by John, the Bishop of the
Royal City.&mdash;Origen on the other hand says that she who,
in S. Matthew and S. Mark, poured the ointment in the
house of Simon the leper was a different person from the
sinner whom S. Luke writes about who poured the ointment
on His feet in the house of the Pharisee.&mdash;Apolinarius<note place="foot">So in the
<hi rend='italic'>Catena</hi> of Corderius, in <hi rend='italic'>S. Joannem</hi>, p.
302.</note> and Theodorus say that all the Evangelists mention one and the
same person; but that John rehearses the story more accurately
than the others. It is plain, however, that Matthew,
Mark, and John speak of the same individual; for
they relate that Bethany was the scene of the transaction;
and this is a <emph>village</emph>; whereas Luke [viii. 37] speaks of some
one else; for, <q>Behold,</q> (saith he) <q>a woman <emph>in the city</emph>
which was <emph>a sinner</emph>,</q></q> &amp;c., &amp;c.
</p>

<pb n="278"/><anchor id="Pg278"/>

<p>
But the most important instance by far of independent
and sound judgment is supplied by that concluding paragraph,
already quoted and largely remarked upon, at pp.
<ref target="Pg064">64-5</ref>; in which, after rehearsing all that had been said
against the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel, Victor
vindicates their genuineness by appealing in his own person
to the best and the most authentic copies. The Reader is
referred to Victor's Text, which is given below, at p. <ref target="Pg288">288</ref>.
</p>

<p>
It only remains to point out, that since Chrysostom, (whom
Victor speaks of as ὁ ἐν ἁγίοις,[p. 408,] and ὁ μακαριος,
[p. 442,]) died in <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 407, it <emph>cannot</emph>
be right to quote <q>401</q>
as the date of Victor's work. Rather would <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 450 be
a more reasonable suggestion: seeing that extracts from
Cyril, who lived on till <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 444, are found here and there
in Victor's pages. We shall not perhaps materially err
if we assign <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 430-450 as Victor of Antioch's approximate
date.
</p>

<p>
I conclude these notices of an unjustly neglected Father,
by specifying the MSS. which contain his Work. Dry
enough to ordinary readers, these pages will not prove uninteresting
to the critical student. An enumeration of all
the extant Codices with which I am acquainted which contain
<hi rend="smallcaps">Victor of Antioch's</hi> Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel,
follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(i.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 12 ( = Reg. 230) <hi rend='italic'>a most
beautiful MS.</hi>
</p>

<p>
The Commentary on S. Mark is here assigned to <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi> by
name; being a recension very like that which Matthaei has published.
S. Mark's text is given <hi rend='italic'>in extenso</hi>.
</p>

<p>
(ii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 19 ( = Reg. 189: anciently numbered 437 and
1880. Also 134 and 135. At back, 1603.) <hi rend='italic'>A grand folio, well-bound
and splendidly written. Pictures of the Evangelists in such
marvellous condition that the very tools employed by a scribe might be
reproduced. The ground gilded. Headings, &amp;c. and words from
Scripture all in gold.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Here also the Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel is assigned to
<hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>. The differences between this text and that of Cramer
(e.g. at fol. 320-3, 370,) are hopelessly numerous and complicated.
There seem to have been extraordinary liberties taken with the
text of this copy throughout.
</p>

<pb n="279"/><anchor id="Pg279"/>

<p>
(iii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 20 (= Reg. 188: anciently numbered 1883.)
<hi rend='italic'>A splendid
folio,&mdash;the work of several hands and beautifully written.</hi>
</p>

<p>
Victor's Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel is generally considered
to be claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyril of Alexandria</hi> by the following
words:
</p>

<p>
ΥΠΟΘΕΣΙΣ ΕΙΣ ΤΟ ΚΑΤΑ ΜΑΡΚΟΝ ΑΓΙΟΝ ΕΥΑΓΓΕΛΙΟΝ<lb/>
ΕΚ ΤΗΣ ΕΙΣ ΑΥΤΟΝ ΕΡΜΗΝΕΙΑΣ ΤΟΥ ΕΝ ΑΓΙΟΙΣ<lb/>
ΚΥΡΙΛΛΟΥ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΕΙΑΣ.
</p>

<p>
The correspondence between Evan. 20 and Evan. 300 [<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>,
No. xiv], (= Reg. 188 and 186), is extraordinary.<note place="foot">I believe it
will be found that Cod. Reg. 186 corresponds <emph>exactly</emph> with Cod.
Reg. 188: also that the contents of Cod. Reg. 201 correspond with those of
Cod. Reg. 206; to which last two, I believe is to be added Cod. Reg. 187.</note>
In S. Mark's Gospel, (which alone I examined,) <emph>every page begins with the same
syllable, both of Text and Commentary</emph>: (i.e. Reg. 186, fol. 94 to 197
= Reg. 188, fol. 87 to 140). Not that the number of words and letters
in every line corresponds: but the discrepancy is compensated
for by a blank at the end of each column, and at the foot of each
page. Evan. 20 and Evan. 300 seem, therefore, in some mysterious
way referable to a common original. The sacred Text of these two
MSS., originally very dissimilar, has been made identical throughout;
some very ancient (the original?) possessor of Reg. 188 having
carefully assimilated the readings of his MS. to those of Reg. 186,
the more roughly written copy; which therefore, in the judgment
of the possessor of Reg. 188, exhibits the purer text. But how
then does it happen that in both Codices alike, each of the Gospels
(except S. Matthew's Gospel in Reg. 188,) ends with the attestation
that it has been collated with approved copies? Are we to suppose
that the colophon in question was added <emph>after</emph> the one text had been

attention. The reader is reminded that these two Codices have
already come before us at pp. <ref target="Pg118">118-9</ref>,&mdash;where see the notes.

<p>
I proceed to set down some of the discrepancies between the
texts of these two MSS.: in every one of which, Reg. 188 has been
made conformable to Reg. 186:&mdash;

In the 2nd, 3rd, and 6th of these instances, Tischendorf is found
(1869) to adopt the readings of Reg. 188: in the last four, those of
Reg. 186. In the 1st, 4th, and 5th, he follows neither.

<p>
Note, that this Codex has been mutilated at p. 70-1; from
S. Matth. xxvii. 20 to S. Mark iv. 22 being away. It cannot therefore
be ascertained whether the Commentary on S. Mark was here
attributed to Victor or not. Cramer employed it largely in his
edition of Victor (<hi rend='italic'>Catenae</hi>, vol. i. p. xxix,), as I have explained
already at p. <ref target="Pg271">271</ref>. Some notices of the present Codex are given

<p>
At fol. 172, the Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>.
It will be found that Coisl. 23 (<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, No. ix.) and
Coisl. 195 are derived from a common original; but Cod. 195 is the more perfect
copy, and should have been employed by Cramer in preference

</p>

<p>
The Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi> at fol. 117.
It seems to be very much the same recension which is exhibited by
Coisl. 19 (<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, No. xviii.) and Coisl. 24
(<hi rend='italic'>infrà</hi>, No. xi.) The Text

</p>

<p>
The Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>: but is very
dissimilar in its text from that which forms the basis of Cramer's
editions. (See above, on No. vi.) It is Cramer's <q>P.</q> (See his
<hi rend='italic'>Catenae</hi>, vol. i. p. xxviii; and

</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
No Author's name is prefixed to the Commentary (fol. 103);

<hi rend='italic'>in extenso</hi>: the Commentary, in the margin.
</p>

<p>
(xi.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 41 (= Coisl. 24.) <hi rend='italic'>Fol.</hi>

This is a Commentary, not a Text. It is expressly claimed for
<hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>. The recension seems to approximate to that published by
Matthaei. (See on No. viii.) One leaf is missing. (See fol. 136 b.)
</p>

<p>
(xii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 50 (= Bodl. Laud. Gracc. 33.) 4to. The Commentary

</p>

<p>
At fol. 94, the Commentary on S. Mark is claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Cyril of
Alexandria</hi>, in the same equivocal manner as above in No. iii
and xii. The writer states in the colophon that he had diversely
found it ascribed to Cyril and to Victor. (ἐπληρώθη σὺν

</p>

<p>
The Commentary is here claimed for <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi>. This is not properly
a text of the Gospel; but parts of the text interwoven with
the Commentary. Take a specimen<note place="foot">Note, that this recurs at fol. 145

(xx.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 304 ( = Reg. 194. Teller 1892.)
The text of S. Mark is hero interwoven with a Commentary
which I do not recognise. But from the correspondence of a note
at the end with what is found in Possinus, pp. 361-3, I am led to
suspect that the contents of this MS. will be found to correspond
with what Possinus published and designated as <q>Tolosanus.</q>
</p>

<p>
(xxi.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 77 (Vind. Ness. 114, Lambec. 29.)
Victor's Commentary is here anonymous.

<p>
(xxii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 92 (which belonged to Faesch of Basle
[see Wetstein's <hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi>], and which Haenel [p. 658
<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>] says is now in Basle
Library). Wetstein's account of this Codex shows that the Commentary
on S. Mark is here distinctly ascribed to Victor. He says,&mdash;<q>Continet
Marcum et in eum <hi rend='italic'>Victoris Antiocheni Commentarios</hi>,
foliis 5 mutilos. Item Scholia in Epistolas Catholicas,</q> &amp;c. And
so Haenel.

<p>
(xxiii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 94 (As before, precisely; except that Haenel's
[inaccurate] notice is at p. 657 <hi rend='italic'>b</hi>.) This Codex contains
<hi rend="smallcaps">Victor</hi> of Antioch's Commentary on S. Mark, (which is evidently
hero also assigned to him <emph>by name</emph>;) and Titus of Bostra on S. Luke. Also
several Scholia: among the rest, I suspect, (from what Haenel
says), the Scholia spoken of <hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg047">47</ref>, note (x).

<p>
(xxiv.) In addition to the preceding, and before mentioning

(xxvi.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 129 (Vat. 358.) ΒΙΚΤΟΡΟΣ. ΠΓ ΑΝΤΙΟΧ ΕΡΜ ΕΙΣ ΚΑΤΑ

and down the side of each page; and there are references (α, β, γ)
inserted in the text to the paragraphs in the margin,&mdash;as in some
of the MSS. at Paris. Prefixed is an exegetical apparatus by
Eusebius, &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
Note, that of these five MSS. in the Vatican, (358, 756, 757,
1229, 1445), the 3rd and 4th are without the prefatory section
(beginning πολλῶν εἰς τὸ κατὰ Μ.)&mdash;All 5 begin, Μάρκος ὁ εὐαγγελιστής.
In all but the 4th, the second paragraph begins σαφέστερον.
</p>

<p>
The third passage begins in all 5, Ἰσοδυναμεῖ τοῦτο. Any one seeking
to understand this by a reference to the editions of Cramer or of
Possinus will recognise the truth of what was stated above, p.

</p>

<p>
(xxvii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 137 (Vat. 756.) The Commentary is written as
in Vat. 358 (No. xxvi): but no Author's name is given.
</p>

<p>
(xxviii.) <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 138 (Vat. 757.) On a blank page or fly-leaf at
the beginning are these words:&mdash;ὁ ἀντίγραφος (<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>) οὗτος
ἐστὶν ὁ Πέτρος ὁ τῆς Λαοδικείας ὅστις προηγεῖται τῶν ἄλλων ἐξηγητῶν ενταῦθα.
(Comp. No. xlvii.) The Commentary and Text are not kept distinct,
as in the preceding Codex. Both are written in an ill-looking,
slovenly hand.
</p>

<p>

In conclusion, it can scarcely require to be pointed out
that <hi rend="smallcaps">Victor's</hi> Commentary,&mdash;of which the Church in her
palmiest days shewed herself so careful to multiply copies,
and of which there survive to this hour such a vast number
of specimens,&mdash;must needs anciently have enjoyed very peculiar
favour. It is evident, in fact, that an Epitome of Chrysostom's
Homilies on S. Matthew, together with <emph><hi rend="smallcaps">Victor's</hi>
compilation on S. Mark</emph>,&mdash;Titus of Bostra on S. Luke,&mdash;and
a work in the main derived from Chrysostom's Homilies on
S. John;&mdash;that these four constituted the established Commentary
of ancient Christendom on the fourfold Gospel. Individual
copyists, no doubt, will have been found occasionally
to abridge certain of the Annotations, and to omit others:
or else, out of the multitude of Scholia by various ancient
Fathers which were evidently once in circulation, and must
have been held in very high esteem,&mdash;(Irenæus, Origen,
Ammonius, Eusebius, Apolinarius, Cyril, Chrysostom, the
Gregorys, Basil, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Theodore
of Heraclea,) they will have introduced extracts according
to their individual caprice. In this way, the general
sameness of the several copies is probably to be accounted
for, while their endless discrepancy in matters of detail is
perhaps satisfactorily explained.

I have thought this very remarkable specimen of the method
of an ancient and (as I think) unjustly neglected Commentator,
deserving of extraordinary attention. Besides
presenting the reader, therefore, with what seems to be a
fair approximation to the original text of the passage, I have
subjoined as many various readings as have come to my
knowledge. It is hoped that they are given with tolerable
exactness; but I have been too often obliged to depend on
printed books and the testimony of others. I can at least
rely on the readings furnished me from the Vatican.

<p>
More pains than enough (it will perhaps be thought)
have been taken to exhibit accurately this short Scholion.
And yet, it has not been without design (the reader may be
sure) that so many various readings have been laboriously
accumulated. The result, it is thought, is eminently instructive,
and (to the student of Ecclesiastical Antiquity) important
also.
</p>

<p>
For it will be perceived by the attentive reader that not
more than two or three of the multitude of various readings
afforded by this short Scholion can have possibly resulted
from careless transcription.<note place="foot">e.g. οὐκ ἦν δέ for οὐ κεῖνται.</note>
The rest have been unmistakably
occasioned by the merest licentiousness: every
fresh Copyist evidently considering himself at liberty to take
just whatever liberties he pleased with the words before
<pb n="290"/><anchor id="Pg290"/>
him. To amputate, or otherwise to mutilated; to abridge; to
amplify; to transpose; to remodel;&mdash;this has been the rule
with all. The <emph>types</emph> (so to speak) are reducible to two, or
at most to three; but the varieties are almost as numerous
as the MSS. of Victor's work.
</p>

<p>
And yet it is impossible to doubt that this Scholion was
originally one, and one only. Irrecoverable perhaps, in
some of its minuter details, as the actual text of Victor
may be, it is nevertheless self-evident that <emph>in the main</emph> we
are in possession of what he actually wrote on this occasion.
In spite of all the needless variations observable in the manner
of stating a certain fact, it is still unmistakably one and
the same fact which is every time stated. It is invariably
declared,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1.) That from certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel the last
Twelve Verses had been <hi rend="smallcaps">LEFT OUT</hi>; and (2) That this had
been done because their genuineness had been by certain
persons suspected: but, (3) That the Writer, convinced of
their genuineness, had restored them to their rightful place;
(4) Because he had found them in accurate copies, and in the
authentic Palestinian copy, which had supplied him with
his exemplar.
</p>

<p>
It is obvious to suggest that after familiarizing ourselves
with this specimen of what proves to have been the licentious
method of the ancient copyists in respect of the text of an
early Father, we are in a position to approach more intelligently
the Commentary of Victor itself; and, to some extent,
to understand how it comes to pass that so many liberties
have been taken with it throughout. The Reader is
reminded of what has been already offered on this subject at
pp. <ref target="Pg272">272-3</ref>.

<quote rend="display">
On the Relative antiquity of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Codex Vaticanus</hi> (B),
and the <hi rend="smallcaps">Codex Sinaiticus</hi> (א).
</quote>

<p>
(Referred to at p. <ref target="Pg070">70</ref>.)
</p>

<p>
I. <q>Vix differt aetate a Codice Sinaitico,</q> says Tischendorf,
(<hi rend='italic'>ed. 8va</hi>, 1869, p. ix,) speaking of the Codex Vaticanus
(B). Yet does he perpetually designate his own Sinaitic
Codex (א) as <q>omnium antiquissimus.</q> Now,
</p>

<p>
(1) The (all but unique) sectional division of the Text of
Codex B,&mdash;confessedly the oldest scheme of chapters extant,
is in itself a striking note of primitiveness. The author of
the Codex knew nothing, apparently, of the Eusebian method.
But I venture further to suggest that the following peculiarities
in Codex א unmistakably indicate for it a later date
than Codex B.
</p>

<p>
(2) Cod. א, (like C, and other later MSS.,) is broken up
into short paragraphs throughout. The Vatican Codex, on
the contrary, has very few breaks indeed: e.g. it is without
break of any sort from S. Matth. xvii. 24 to xx. 17: whereas,
within the same limits, there are in Cod. א as many as <emph>thirty</emph>
interruptions of the context. From S. Mark xiii. 1 to the
end of the Gospel the text is absolutely continuous in Cod. B,
except in <emph>one</emph> place: but in Cod. א it is interrupted upwards
of <emph>fifty</emph> times. Again: from S. Luke xvii. 11, to the end of
the Gospel there is but <emph>one</emph> break in Cod. B. But it is
broken into well nigh <emph>an hundred and fifty</emph> short paragraphs
in Cod. א.
</p>

<p>
There can be no doubt that the unbroken text of Codex B,
(resembling the style of the papyrus of <hi rend='italic'>Hyperides</hi> published
by Mr. Babington,) is the more ancient. The only places
where it approximates to the method of Cod. א, is where
the Commandments are briefly recited (S. Matth. xix. 18,
&amp;c.), and where our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> proclaims the eight Beatitudes
(S. Matth. v.)
</p>

<pb n="292"/><anchor id="Pg292"/>

<p>
(3) Again; Cod. א is prone to exhibit, on extraordinary
occasions, <emph>a single word</emph> in a line, as at&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Matth. xv. 30.</hi><lb/>
ΧΩΛΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΤΥΦΛΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΚΥΛΛΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΚΩΦΟΥΣ
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Mark x. 29.</hi><lb/>
Η ΑΔΕΛΦΑΣ<lb/>
Η ΠΑΤΕΡΑ<lb/>
Η ΜΗΤΕΡΑ<lb/>
Η ΤΕΚΝΑ<lb/>
Η ΑΓΡΟΥΣ
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Luke xiv. 13</hi><lb/>
ΠΤΩΧΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΑΝΑΠΗΡΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΧΩΛΟΥΣ<lb/>
ΤΥΦΛΟΥΣ
</p>

<p>
This became a prevailing fashion in the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century; e.g. when the Cod. Laudianus of the Acts (E) was written. The
only trace of anything of the kind in Cod. B is at the Genealogy
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi>.
</p>

<p>
(4) At the commencement of every fresh paragraph, the
initial letter in Cod. א <emph>slightly projects into the margin</emph>,&mdash;beyond
the left hand edge of the column; as usual in all
later MSS. This characteristic is only not undiscoverable
in Cod. B. Instances of it there are in the earlier Codex;
but they are of exceedingly rare occurrence.
</p>

<p>
(5) Further; Cod. א abounds in such contractions as ΑΝΟΣ,
ΟΥΝΟΣ (with all their cases), for ΑΝΘΡΩΠΟΣ, ΟΥΡΑΝΟΣ, &amp;c. Not
only ΠΝΑ, ΠΗΡ, ΠΕΡ, ΠΡΑ, ΜΡΑ (for ΠΝΕΥΜΑ, ΠΑΤΗΡ-ΤΕΡ-ΤΕΡΑ,
ΜΗΤΕΡΑ), but also ΣΤΡΘΗ, ΙΗΛ, ΙΗΛΗΜ, for ΣΤΑΥΡΩΘΗ, ΙΣΡΑΗΛ,
ΙΕΡΟΥΣΑΛΗΜ.
</p>

<p>
But Cod. B, though familiar with ΙΣ, and a few other of
the most ordinary abbreviations, knows nothing of these
compendia: which certainly <emph>cannot</emph> have existed in the earliest
copies of all. Once more, it seems reasonable to suppose
that their constant occurrence in Cod א indicates for
that Codex a date subsequent to Cod. B.
</p>

<p>
(6) The very discrepancy observable between these two
Codices in their method of dealing with <q>the last twelve
verses of S. Mark's Gospel,</q> (already adverted to at p. <ref target="Pg088">88</ref>,)
is a further indication, and as it seems to the present writer
a very striking one, that Cod. B is the older of the two.
Cod. א is evidently <emph>familiar</emph> with the phenomenon which
<emph>astonishes</emph> Cod. B by its novelty and strangeness.
</p>

<p>
(7) But the most striking feature of difference, after all,
is only to be recognised by one who surveys the Codices
themselves with attention. It is <emph>that</emph> general air of primitiveness
<pb n="293"/><anchor id="Pg293"/>
in Cod. B which makes itself at once <emph>felt</emph>. The even
symmetry of the unbroken columns;&mdash;the work of the <hi rend='italic'>prima
manus</hi> everywhere vanishing through sheer antiquity;&mdash;the
small, even, <emph>square</emph> writing, which partly recalls the style
of the Herculanean rolls; partly, the papyrus fragments
of the <hi rend='italic'>Oration against Demosthenes</hi> (published by Harris in
1848):&mdash;all these notes of superior antiquity infallibly set
Cod. B before Cod. א; though it may be impossible to determine
whether by 50, by 75, or by 100 years.
</p>

<p>
II. It has been conjectured by one whose words are always
entitled to most respectful attention, that Codex Sinaiticus
may have been <q>one of the fifty Codices of Holy Scripture
which Eusebius prepared <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 331, by Constantine's
direction, for the use of the new Capital.</q> (Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Collation of the Cod. Sin.</hi>, Introd. p. xxxvii-viii.)
</p>

<p>
1. But this, which is rendered improbable by the many
instances of grave discrepancy between its readings and
those with which Eusebius proves to have been most familiar,
is made impossible by the discovery that it is without
S. Mark xv. 28, which constitutes the Eusebian Section
numbered <q>216</q> in S. Mark's Gospel. [Quite in vain has
Tischendorf perversely laboured to throw doubt on this circumstance.
It remains altogether undeniable,&mdash;as a far less
accomplished critic than Tischendorf may see at a glance.
Tischendorf's only plea is the fact that in Cod. M, (he
might have added and in the Codex Sinaiticus, <emph>which explains
the phenomenon</emph> in Cod. M), <emph>against ver.</emph> 29 is set the number,
<q>216,</q> instead of against ver. 28. But what then? Has
not the number <emph>demonstrably</emph> lost its place? And is there
not <emph>still</emph> one of the Eusebian Sections missing? And <emph>which</emph>
can it <emph>possibly</emph> have been, if it was not S. Mark xv. 28?]
Again. Cod. א, (like B, C, L, U, Γ, and some others), gives the
piercing of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> side at S. Matth. xxvii. 49: but if
Eusebius had read that incident in the same place, he would
have infallibly included S. John xix. 34, 35, with S. Matth.
xxvii. 49, in his vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
Canon, where matters are contained which are common to S. Matthew and S.
John,&mdash;instead of referring S. John xix. 31-37 to his
x<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Canon, which
<pb n="294"/><anchor id="Pg294"/>
specifies things peculiar to each of the four Evangelists.
Eusebius, moreover, in a certain place (<hi rend='italic'>Dem. Evan.</hi> x. 8
[quoted by Tisch.]) has an allusion to the same transaction,
and expressly says that it is recorded <emph>by S. John</emph>.
</p>

<p>
2. No inference as to the antiquity of this Codex can be
drawn from the Eusebian notation of Sections in the margin:
<emph>that</emph> notation having been confessedly added at a subsequent
date.
</p>

<p>
3. On the other hand, the subdivision of Cod. א into paragraphs,
proves to have been made without any reference to
the sectional distribution of Eusebius. Thus, there are in
the Codex thirty distinct paragraphs from S. Matthew xi. 20
to xii. 34, inclusive; but there are comprised within the
same limits only seventeen Eusebian sections. And yet, of
those seventeen sections only nine correspond with as many
paragraphs of the Codex Sinaiticus. This, in itself, is enough
to prove that Eusebius knew nothing of the present Codex.
His record is express:&mdash;ἐφ᾽ ἐκάστῳ τῶν τεσσάρων εὐαγγελίων
ἀριθμός τις πρόκειται κατὰ μέρος κ.τ.λ.
</p>

<p>
III. The supposed resemblance of the opened volume to
an Egyptian papyrus,&mdash;when eight columns (σελίδες) are
exhibited to the eye at once, side by side,&mdash;seems to be a fallacious
note of high antiquity. If Cod. א has four columns
in a page,&mdash;Cod. B three,&mdash;Cod. A two,&mdash;Cod. C has only
one. But Cod. C is certainly as old as Cod. A. Again,
Cod. D, which is of the vi<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
century, is written (like Cod. C)
across the page: yet was it <q>copied from an older model
similarly divided in respect to the lines or verses,</q>&mdash;and
therefore similarly written across the page. It is almost
obvious that the size of the skins on which a Codex was
written will have decided whether the columns should be
four or only three in a page.
</p>

<p>
IV. In fine, nothing doubting the high antiquity of both
Codices, (B and א,) I am nevertheless fully persuaded that
an interval of at least half a century,&mdash;if not of a far greater
span of years,&mdash;is absolutely required to account for the
marked dissimilarity between them.

<p>
It will be perceived from this, that <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> subdivides
these three portions of the sacred Narrative into ten Sections
(<q>§§;</q>)&mdash;of which three belong to S. Matthew, viz.
§§ 20, 21, 22:&mdash;three to S. Mark, viz. §§ 9, 10, 11:&mdash;four to
S. Luke, viz. §§ 29, 30, 31, 32: which ten Sections, <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>
distributed over four of his Canons: referring three
of there to his II<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi> Canon,
(which exhibits what S. Matthew, S. Mark, and S. Luke have in common); four of them to
his VI<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Canon, (which shews what S. Matthew
and S. Mark have in common); one, to his IX<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>,
(which contains what is common to S. Luke and S. John); two, to his
X<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, (in
which is found what is peculiar to each Evangelist.)
</p>

<p>
Now, the design which <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> had in breaking up this
portion of the sacred Text, (S. Matth. iv. 18-22, S. Mark
i. 16-20, S. Luke v. 1-11,) after so arbitrary a fashion,
into ten portions; divorcing three of those Sections from
S. Matthew's Gospel, (viz. S. Luke's §§ 29, 30, 31); and
connecting one of these last three (§ 30) <emph>with two Sections</emph>
(§§ 219, 222) <emph>of S. John;</emph>&mdash;is perfectly plain. His object
was, (as he himself explains,) to shew&mdash;not only (<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) what
S. Matthew has in common with S. Mark and S. Luke; but also (<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>)
<emph>what S. Luke has in common with S. John</emph>;&mdash;as well
as (<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>) what S. Luke has <emph>peculiar to himself</emph>.
But, in the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>, <emph>as far as we know
anything about that work</emph>, all this would have been simply impossible. (I have
already described his <q>Diatessaron,</q> at pp. <ref target="Pg126">126-7</ref>.) Intent
on exhibiting the Sections of the other Gospels which correspond
with the Sections of <emph>S. Matthew</emph>, <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi> would
not if he could,&mdash;(and he could not if he would,)&mdash;have dissociated
from its context S. Luke's account of the first
miraculous draught of fishes in the beginning of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi>
Ministry, for the purpose of establishing its resemblance to
S. John's account of the <emph>second</emph> miraculous draught of fishes
which took place after the Resurrection, and is only found
in S. John's Gospel. These Sections therefore are
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebian</hi>,</q>
not <emph>Ammonian</emph>. They are <emph>necessary</emph>, according to the
scheme of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>. They are not only unnecessary and
even meaningless, but actually impossible, in the <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonian</hi>
scheme.
</p>

<pb n="297"/><anchor id="Pg297"/>

<p>
2. Let me call attention to another, and, as I think,
a more convincing instance. I am content in fact to narrow
the whole question to the following single issue:&mdash;Let me
be shewn how it is rationally conceivable that <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>
can have split up S. John xxi. 12, 13, into <emph>three distinct Sections</emph>;
and S. John xxi. 15, 16, 17, into <emph>six?</emph> and yet, after
so many injudicious disintegrations of the sacred Text, how
it is credible that he can have made but <emph>one</emph> Section of
S. John xxi. 18 to 25,&mdash;which nevertheless, from its very
varied contents, confessedly requires even <emph>repeated</emph> subdivision?...
Why <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> did all this, is abundantly plain.
His peculiar plan constrained him to refer the <emph>former</emph> half
of ver. 12,&mdash;the <emph>latter</emph> half of verses 15, 16, 17&mdash;to his
IX<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>
Canon, where S. Luke and S. John are brought together;
(ἐν ᾧ οἱ δύο τὰ παρακλήσια εἰρήκασι):&mdash;and to consign the
<emph>latter</emph> half of ver. 12,&mdash;the <emph>former</emph>
half of verses 15, 16, 17,&mdash;together with the whole of the <emph>last eight
verses</emph> of S. John's Gospel, to his
X<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> (or last) Canon, where what is peculiar
to each of the four Evangelists is set down, (ἐν ᾧ περὶ τίνων
ἕκαστος αὐτῶν ἰδίως ἀνέγραψεν.) But <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>, because
he confessedly <emph>recognised no such Canons</emph>, was under no such
constraint. He had in fact <emph>no such opportunity</emph>. He therefore
simply <emph>cannot</emph> have adopted the same extraordinary
sectional subdivision.
</p>

<p>
3. To state the matter somewhat differently, and perhaps
to exhibit the argument in a more convincing form:&mdash;The
Canons of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>, and the so-called
<q><hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonian <emph>Sections</emph></hi>,</q>&mdash;(by
which, confessedly, nothing else whatever is
<emph>meant</emph> but the Sections of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>,)&mdash;are
discovered mutually to imply one another. Those Canons are without
meaning or use apart from the Sections,&mdash;for the sake of
which they were clearly invented. Those Sections, whatever
convenience they may possess apart from the Canons, nevertheless
are discovered to presuppose the Canons throughout:
to be manifestly subsequent to them in order of time: to
depend upon them for their very existence: in some places
to be even unaccountable in the eccentricity of their arrangement,
except when explained by the requirements of
the <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebian</hi> Canons. I say&mdash;<emph>That</emph>
particular sectional subdivision,
<pb n="298"/><anchor id="Pg298"/>
in other words, to which the epithet <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonian</hi></q>
is popularly applied,&mdash;(applied however without authority,
and in fact by the merest license,)&mdash;proves on careful inspection
to have been only capable of being devised by one
<emph>who was already in possession of the Canons of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi></emph>. In plain terms, they are
demonstrably <emph>the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>
himself</emph>,&mdash;who expressly claims <emph>The Canons</emph> for his own (κανόνας
δέκα τὸν ἀριθμὸν διεχάραξά σοι), and leaves it to be
inferred that he is the Author of the Sections also. Wetstein
(<hi rend='italic'>Proleg.</hi> p. 70,) and Bishop Lloyd (in the <q>Monitum</q>
prefixed to his ed. of the Greek Test. p. x,) so understand
the matter; and Mr. Scrivener (<hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>, p. 51) evidently
inclines to the same opinion.
</p>

<p>
II. I desire, in the next place, to point out that a careful
inspection of the Eusebian <q>Sections,</q> (for Eusebius himself
calls them περικοπαί, not κεφάλαια,) leads inevitably to the
inference that they are only rightly understood when regarded
in the light of <q><hi rend="smallcaps">Marginal References</hi>.</q> This has
been hitherto overlooked. Bp. Lloyd, in the interesting
<q>Monitum</q> already quoted, remarks of the Eusebian Canons,&mdash;<q>quorum
haec est utilitas, ut eorum scilicet ope quivis,
nullo labore, Harmoniam sibi quatuor Evangeliorum possit
conficere.</q> The learned Prelate can never have made the
attempt in this way <q>Harmoniam sibi conficere,</q> or he
would not have so written. He evidently did not advert to
the fact that Eusebius refers his readers (in his
III<hi rend="vertical-align: super">rd</hi> Canon)
from S. John's account of the <emph>Healing of the Nobleman's son</emph>
to the account given by S. Matthew and S. Luke of the
<emph>Healing of the Centurion's servant</emph>. It is perfectly plain in fact
that to enable a reader <q>to construct for himself <emph>a Harmony
of the Gospels</emph>,</q> was no part of Eusebius' intention;
and quite certain that any one who shall ever attempt to
avail himself of the system of Sections and Canons before us
with that object, will speedily find himself landed in hopeless
confusion.<note place="foot">There was published at the University Press in 1805,
a handsome quarto volume (pp. 216) entitled <hi rend='italic'>Harmonia quatuor
Evangeliorum juxta Sectiones Ammonianas et Eusebii Canones</hi>. It is merely the
contents of the X Canons of Eusebius printed <hi rend='italic'>in
extenso</hi>,&mdash;and of course is no <q>Harmony</q> at all. It would have been
a really useful book, notwithstanding; but that the editor, strange to say, has
omitted to number the sections.</note>
</p>

<pb n="299"/><anchor id="Pg299"/>

<p>
But in fact there is no danger of his making much progress
in his task. His first discovery would probably be
that S. John's weighty doctrinal statements concerning our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> <emph>Eternal <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>head</emph>
in chap. i. 1-5: 9, 10: 14, are represented as parallel with the
<emph>Human Genealogy</emph> of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> as recorded by
S. Matthew i. 1-16, and by S. Luke
iii. 23-38:&mdash;the next, that the first half of the Visit of
the Magi (S. Matthew ii. 1-6) is exhibited as corresponding
with S. John vii. 41, 42.&mdash;Two such facts ought to open
the eyes of a reader of ordinary acuteness quite wide to
the true nature of the Canons of Eusebius. They are <emph>Tables
of Reference only</emph>.
</p>

<p>
Eusebius has in fact himself explained his object in constructing
them; which (he says) was twofold: (1<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi>) To enable
a reader to see at a glance, <q><emph>which</emph> of the Evangelists
have said <emph>things of the same kind</emph>,</q> (τίνες τὰ παραπλήσια
εἰρήκαςι: the phrase occurs <emph>four times</emph> in the course of his
short Epistle): and (2<hi rend="vertical-align: super">ndly</hi>), To
enable him to find out <emph>where</emph>
they have severally done so: (τοὺς οἰκείους ἑκάστου εὐαγγελιστοῦ
τόπους, ἐν οἶς κατὰ τῶν αὐτῶν ἠνέχθησαν εἰπεῖν;
Eusebius uses the phrase <emph>twice</emph>.) But this, (as all are aware)
is precisely the office of (what are called) <q>Marginal References.</q>
Accordingly,
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>a.</hi>) Whether referring <emph>from</emph> S. Matth. x. 40 (§ 98);
S. Mark ix. 37 (§ 96); or S. Luke x. 16 (§ 116);&mdash;we find ourselves
referred <emph>to</emph> the following <emph>six</emph> places of S. John,&mdash;v. 23:
xii. 44, 45: xiii. 20: xiv. 21: xiv. 24, 25: xv. 23<note place="foot">This last §
according to <hi rend='italic'>Tischendorf's</hi> ed. of the Eusebian Canons.</note>
(= §§ 40, 111, 120, 129, 131, 144.) Again,
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>b.</hi>) Whether we refer <emph>from</emph> S. Matth. xi. 27 (§§
111, 112,) or S. Luke x. 22 (§ 119),&mdash;we find ourselves referred <emph>to</emph>
the following <emph>eleven</emph> places of S. John,&mdash;i. 18: iii. 35: v. 37:
vi. 46: vii. 28, 29: viii. 19: x. 15: xiii. 3: xv. 21: xvi. 15:
xvii. 25 (§§ 8, 30, 44, 61, 76, 87, 90, 114, 142, 148, 154.)
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>c.</hi>) So also, from S. Matthew's (xvi. 13-16), S. Mark's
(viii. 27-29), and S. Luke's (ix. 18-20) account of S.
<pb n="300"/><anchor id="Pg300"/>
Peters Confession at Cæsarea Philippi,&mdash;we are referred
to S. John i. 42, 43,&mdash;a singular reference; and to S. John
vi. 68, 69.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>d.</hi>) From the mention of the last Passover by the three
earlier Evangelists, (S. Matth. xxvi. 1, 2: S. Mark xiv. 1:
S. Luke xxii. 1,) we are referred to S. John's mention of the
<emph>first</emph> Passover (ii. 13 = § 20); and of the <emph>second</emph> (vi. 4 =
§ 48); as well as of the fourth (xi. 55 = § 96.)
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>e.</hi>) From the words of Consecration at the Last Supper,
as recorded by S. Matth. (xxvi. 16), S. Mark (xiv. 22), and
S. Luke (xxii. 19),&mdash;we are referred to the four following
Sections of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Discourse in the Synagogue at Capernaum
recorded by S. John, which took place a year before,&mdash;S.
John vi. 35, 36: 48: 51: 55: (§§ 55, 63, 65, 67).
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>f.</hi>) Nothing but the spirit in which <q>Marginal References</q>
are made would warrant a critic in linking together
three incidents like the following,&mdash;similar, indeed, yet entirely
distinct: viz. S. Matth. xxvii. 34: S. Mark xv. 24:
and S. John xix. 28, 29.
</p>

<p>
(<hi rend='italic'>g.</hi>) I was about to say that scarcely could such an excuse
be invented for referring a Reader from S. Luke xxii. 32,
to S. John xxi. 15, and 16, and 17 (= §§ 227, 228, 229,)&mdash;but
I perceive that the same three References stand in the
margin of our own Bibles. Not even the margin of the
English Bible, however, sends a Reader (as the
IX<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Canon
of Eusebius does) from our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> eating <q>broiled fish and
honeycomb,</q> in the presence of the ten Apostles at Jerusalem
on the evening of the first Easter-Day, (S. Luke xxiv.
41-43 (= § 341,)) to His feeding the seven Apostles with
bread and fish at the Sea of Galilee many days after.
(S. John xxi. 9, 10: 12: 13 = §§ 221, 223, 224.)&mdash;And
this may suffice.
</p>

<p>
It is at all events certain that the correctest notion of the
use and the value of the Eusebian Sections will be obtained
by one who will be at the pains to substitute for <emph>the Eusebian
Numbers</emph> in the margin of a copy of the Greek Gospels <emph>the
References</emph> which these numbers severally indicate. It will
then become plain that the system of Sections and Canons
which Eusebius invented,&mdash;ingenious, interesting, and useful
<pb n="301"/><anchor id="Pg301"/>
as it certainly is; highly important also, as being the known
work of an illustrious Father of the Church, as well as most
precious occasionally for critical purposes,<note place="foot">Thus, certain disputed
passages of importance are proved to have been recognised at least
<emph>by Eusebius</emph>. Our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> Agony in the Garden
for instance, (S. Luke xxii. 43, 44&mdash;wanting in Cod. B,) is by him numbered § 283:
and that often rejected verse, S. Mark xv. 28, he certainly numbered §
216,&mdash;whatever Tischendorf may say to the contrary. (See p.
<ref target="Pg203">203</ref>.)</note>&mdash;is nothing else
but a clumsy substitute for what is achieved by an ordinary
<q>Reference Bible</q>:&mdash;participating in every inconvenience
incidental to the unskilfully contrived apparatus with which
English readers are familiar,<note place="foot">It is obvious to suggest that, (1)
whereas our Marginal References follow the order of the Sacred Books, they ought
rather to stand in the order of their importance, or at least of their relevancy to
the matter in hand:&mdash;and that, (2) actual Quotations, and even Allusions to other
parts of Scripture when they are undeniable, should be referred to in some
distinguishing way. It is also certain that, (3) to a far greater extent than at
present, <emph>sets</emph> of References might be kept <emph>together</emph>; not
scattered about in small parcels over the whole Book.&mdash;Above all, (as the point
most pertinent to the present occasion,) (4) it is to be wished that
<emph>strictly parallel places</emph> in the Gospels might be distinguished
from those which are illustrative only, or are merely recalled by their
similarity of subject or expression. All this would admit of interesting and
useful illustration. While on this subject, let me ask,&mdash;Why is it no longer
possible to purchase a Bible with References to the Apocrypha? <emph>Who</emph>
does not miss the reference to <q>Ecclus. xliii. 11, 12</q> at Gen. ix. 14?
<emph>Who</emph> can afford to do without the reference to <q>1 Macc. iv. 59</q> at
S. John x. 22?</note> and yet inferior in the following
four respects:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(1st.) The references of Eusebius, (except those found in
Canon X.), require in every instance to be <emph>deciphered</emph>, before
they can be verified; and they can only be deciphered by
making search, (and sometimes laborious search,) in another
part of the volume. They are not, in fact, (nor do they pretend
to be,) references to the inspired Text at all; but
only <emph>references to the Eusebian Canons</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(2ndly.) In their scope, they are of course strictly <emph>confined
to the Gospels</emph>,&mdash;which most inconveniently limits their use,
as well as diminishes their value. (Thus, by no possibility is
Eusebius able to refer a reader from S. Luke xxii. 19, 20 to
1 Cor. xi. 23-25.)
</p>

<p>
(3rdly.) By the very nature of their constitution, reference
even to <emph>another part of the same Gospel</emph> is impossible. (Eusebius
<pb n="302"/><anchor id="Pg302"/>
is unable, for example, to refer a reader from S. John
xix. 39, to iii. 1 and vii. 50.)
</p>

<p>
But besides the preceding, which are disadvantages inherent
in the scheme and inseparable from it, it will be found
(4thly), That Eusebius, while he introduces not a few wholly
undesirable references, (of which some specimens are supplied
above), is observed occasionally to withhold references
which cannot by any means be dispensed with. Thus, he
omits to refer his reader from S. Luke's account of the visit
to the Sepulchre (chap. xxiv. 12) to S. John's memorable account
of the same transaction (chap. xx. 3-10): <emph>not</emph> because
he disallowed the verse in S. Luke's Gospel,&mdash;for in a certain
place <emph>he discusses its statements</emph>.<note place="foot">Mai, vol. iv. p.
287. See also p. 293.</note>
</p>

<p>
III. It is abundantly plain from all that has gone before
that the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> was entirely different in its
structure and intention from the work of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>. Enough, in
fact, has been said to make it fully apparent that it is
nothing short of impossible that there can have been any
extensive correspondence between the two. According to
<hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>, S. Mark has 21
Sections<note place="foot">Tischendorf says 19 only.</note> <emph>peculiar to his
Gospel</emph>: S. Luke, 72: S. John, 97.<note place="foot">Tischendorf says 96
only.</note> According to the same <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>,
14 Sections<note place="foot">Tischendorf says 13 only.</note> are common to S.
Luke and S. Mark <emph>only</emph>: 21, to S. Luke and S. John <emph>only</emph>.
But those 225 Sections can have found <emph>no place</emph> in the work of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>. And if, (in some unexplained way,) room
<emph>was</emph> found for those parts of the Gospels, <emph>with what possible
motive can <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi> have subdivided
them into exactly 225 portions</emph>? It is nothing else but
irrational to assume that he did so.
</p>

<p>
Not unaware am I that it has been pointed out by a most
judicious living Critic as a <q>ground for hesitation before we
ascribe the Sections as well as the Canons to Eusebius, that
not a few ancient MSS. contain the former while they omit
the latter.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener specifics the following Codd. C, F, H, I,
P, Q, R, W<hi rend="vertical-align: super">6</hi>, Y, Z, 54, 59, 60, 68, 440,
i<hi rend="vertical-align: super">scr</hi>, s<hi rend="vertical-align: super">scr</hi>.
Also D and K. (<hi rend='italic'>Cod. Bezæ</hi>, p. xx, and

thereby <q>that in the judgment of critics and transcribers,
<pb n="303"/><anchor id="Pg303"/>
(whatever that judgment may be deemed worth,) the Ammonian
Sections had a previous existence to the Eusebian
Canons, as well as served for an independent purpose.</q> But
I respectfully demur to the former of the two proposed inferences.
I also learn with surprise that <q>those who have
studied them most, can the least tell what use the Ammonian
Sections can serve, unless in connection with Canons
of Harmony.</q><note place="foot">Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
pp. 51 and 52: <hi rend='italic'>Cod. Bezæ</hi>, p. xx. note [2.]</note>
</p>

<p>
However irregular and arbitrary these subdivisions of the
Evangelical text are observed to be in their construction,
their usefulness is paramount. They are observed to fulfil
<emph>exactly the same office</emph> as our own actual division of the Text
into 89 Chapters and 3780 Verses. Of course, 1165 subdivisions
are (for certain purposes) somewhat less convenient
than 3780;&mdash;but on the other hand, a place in the Gospels
would be more easily discovered, I suspect, for the most part,
by the employment of such a single set of consecutive numbers,
than by requiring a Reader first to find the Chapter by
its Roman numeral, and then the Verse by its Arabic figure.
Be this as it may, there can be at least only one opinion as
to the <emph>supreme convenience to a Reader</emph>, whether ancient or
modern, of knowing that the copy of the Gospels which he
holds in his hands is subdivided into exactly the same 1165
Sections as every other Greek copy which is likely to come
in his way; and that, in every such copy, he may depend on
finding every one of those sections invariably distinguished
by the self-same number.
</p>

<p>
A Greek copy of the Gospels, therefore, having its margin
furnished with the Eusebian <emph>Sectional</emph> notation, may be considered
to correspond generally with an English copy merely
divided into Chapters and Verses. The addition of the
Eusebian <emph>Canons</emph> at the beginning, with numerical references
thereto inserted in the margin throughout, does but
superadd something analogous to the convenience of our
<emph>Marginal References</emph>,&mdash;and may just as reasonably (or just as
unreasonably) be dispensed with.
</p>

<p>
I think it not improbable, in fact, that in the preparation
of a Codex, it will have been sometimes judged commercially
<pb n="304"/><anchor id="Pg304"/>
expedient to leave its purchaser to decide whether he would
or would not submit to the additional expense (which in the
case of illuminated MSS. must have been very considerable)
of having the Eusebian Tables inserted at the commencement
of his Book,<note place="foot">Evan. 263, for instance, has certainly <emph>blank</emph>
Eusebian Tables at the beginning: the <emph>frame</emph> only.</note>&mdash;without
which <emph>the References</emph> thereto would
confessedly have been of no manner of avail. In this way it
will have come to pass, (as Mr. Scrivener points out,) that
<q>not a few ancient MSS. contain the <emph>Sections</emph> but omit the
<emph>Canons</emph>.</q> Whether, however, the omission of References to
the Canons in Copies which retain in the margin the sectional
numbers, is to be explained in this way, or
not,&mdash;<hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>,
at all events, will have had no more to do with
either the one or the other, than with our modern division
into Chapters and Verses. It is, in short, nothing else but
a <q>vulgar error</q> to designate the Eusebian Sections as the
<q>Sections of <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi>.</q> The expression cannot be too
soon banished from our critical terminology. Whether
banished or retained, to <emph>reason about</emph> the lost work of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi> from the Sections of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> (as Tischendorf and the
rest habitually do) is an offence against historical Truth
which no one who values his critical reputation will probably
hereafter venture to commit.
</p>

<p>
IV. This subject may not be dismissed until a circumstance
of considerable interest has been explained which has
already attracted some notice, but which evidently is not yet

<p>
As already remarked, the necessity of resorting to the
Eusebian Tables of Canons in order to make any use of
a marginal reference, is a tedious and a cumbersome process;
for which, men must have early sought to devise a remedy.
They were not slow in perceiving that a far simpler expedient
would be to note at the foot of every page of a Gospel
<emph>the numbers</emph> of the Sections of that Gospel contained
<hi rend='italic'>in extenso</hi>
on the same page; and, parallel with those numbers, to
exhibit the numbers of the corresponding Sections in the
<pb n="305"/><anchor id="Pg305"/>
other Gospels. Many Codices, furnished with such an apparatus
at the foot of the page, are known to exist.<note place="foot">e.g. Codd. M, 262 and
264. (I saw at least one other at Paris, but I have not preserved a record of the
number.) To these, Tregelles adds E; (Scrivener's <hi rend='italic'>Introduction</hi>,
p. 51, note 2.) Scrivener adds W, and Tischendorf T, (Scrivener's
<hi rend='italic'>Cod. Bezae</hi>, p. xx.)</note> For
instance, in Cod. 262 (= Reg. 53, at Paris), which is written
in double columns, at foot of the first page (<hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 111) of
S. Mark, is found as follows:&mdash;

    <figDesc>[Illustration: Apparatus Table From Cod. 262.]</figDesc>

</p>

<p>
The meaning of this, every one will see who,&mdash;(remembering
what is signified by the monograms ΜΡ, ΛΟ, ΙΩ, ΜΘ,<note place="foot">The
<emph>order</emph> of these monograms requires explanation.</note>)&mdash;will
turn successively to the II<hi rend="vertical-align: super">nd</hi>, the
I<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi>, the
VI<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi>, and the
I<hi rend="vertical-align: super">st</hi> of
the Eusebian Canons. Translated into expressions more
familiar to English readers, it evidently amounts to this:
that we are referred,
</p>

<p>
(§ 1) From S. Mark i. 1, 2,&mdash;to S. Matth. xi. 10: S. Luke vii. 27.<lb/>
(§ 2) From S. Mark i. 3,&mdash;to S. Matth. iii. 3: S. Luke iii. 3-6.<lb/>
(§ 3) From S. Mark i. 4, 5, 6,&mdash;to S. Matth. iii. 4-6.<lb/>
(§ 4) From S. Mark i. 7, 8,&mdash;to S. Matth. iii. 11: S. Luke iii. 16: S. John i. 15,
26-27, 30-1: iii. 28.
</p>

<p>
(I venture to add that any one who will compare the
above with the margin of S. Mark's Gospel in a common
English <q>reference Bible,</q> will obtain a very fair notion of
the convenience, and of the inconveniences of the Eusebian
system. But to proceed with our remarks on the apparatus
at the foot of Cod. 262.)
</p>

<p>
The owner of such a MS. was able to refer to parallel passages,
(as above,) <emph>by merely turning over the pages of his book</emph>.
E.g. The parallel places to S. Mark's § 1 (Α) being § 70 of
<pb n="306"/><anchor id="Pg306"/>
S. Luke (Ο) and § 103 of S. Matthew (ΡΓ),&mdash;it was just as
easy for him to find those two places as it is for us to turn
to S. Luke vii. 27 and S. Matth. xi. 10: perhaps easier.
</p>

<p>
V. I suspect that this peculiar method of exhibiting the
Eusebian references (Canons as well as Sections) at a glance,
was derived to the Greek Church from the Syrian Christians.
What is certain, a precisely similar expedient for
enabling readers to discover <emph>Parallel Passages</emph> prevails extensively
in the oldest Syriac Evangelia extant. There are in
the British Museum about twelve Syriac Evangelia furnished
with such an apparatus of reference;<note place="foot">Addit. MSS. 14,449: 14,450, and
1, and 2, and 4, and 6, and 7, and 8: 14,463, and 9: 17,113. (Dr. Wright's
<hi rend='italic'>Catalogue,</hi> 4to. 1870.) Also Rich. 7,157. The reader is referred
to Assemani; and to Adler, p. 52-3: also p. 63.</note> of which a specimen
is subjoined,&mdash;derived however (because it was near at hand)
from a MS. in the Bodleian,<note place="foot"><q>Dawkins 3.</q> See Dean Payne Smith's
<hi rend='italic'>Catalogue</hi>, p. 72.</note> of the
vii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> or
viii<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> century.
</p>

<p>
From this MS., I select for obvious reasons the last page
but one (<hi rend='italic'>fol.</hi> 82) of S. Mark's Gospel, which contains ch.
xvi. 8-18. The Reader will learn with interest and surprise
that in the margin of this page against ver. 8, is
written in vermilion, <emph>by the original scribe</emph>, 281/1: against
ver. 9,&mdash;282/10: against ver. 10,&mdash;283/1: against ver. 11,&mdash;284/8:
against ver. 12:&mdash;285/8: against ver. 13,&mdash;286/8: against
ver. 14,&mdash;287/10: against ver. 15,&mdash;288/6: against ver. 16,&mdash;289/10:
against ver. 19,&mdash;290/8. That these sectional numbers,<note place="foot">It will
be observed that, according to the Syrian scheme, <emph>every verse</emph> of
S. Mark xvi, from ver. 8 to ver. 15 inclusive, constitutes an independent section
(§§ 281-288): ver. 16-18 another (§ 289); and verr. 19-20, another (§ 290), which is
the last. The Greek scheme, as a rule, makes independent sections of verr. 8, 9, 14,
19, 20; but throws together ver. 10-11: 12-13: 15-16: 17-18. (<hi rend='italic'>Vide

with references to the Eusebian Canons subscribed, are no
part of the (so-called) <q><emph>Ammonian</emph></q> system, will be recognised
at a glance. According to <emph>that</emph> scheme, S. Mark
xiv. 8 is numbered 233/2. But to proceed.
</p>

<pb n="307"/><anchor id="Pg307"/>

<p>
At the foot of the same page, (which is written in two
columns), is found the following set of rubricated references
to parallel places in the other three Gospels:&mdash;

The exact English counterpart of which,&mdash;(I owe it to
the kind help of M. Neubauer, of the Bodleian),&mdash;is subjoined.
The Reader will scarcely require to be reminded
that the reason why §§ 282, 287, 289 do not appear in this
Table is because those Sections, (belonging to the tenth
Canon,) have nothing parallel to them in the other Gospels.

<p>
The general intention of this is sufficiently obvious: but
the Reader must be told that on making reference to
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Matthew's</hi>
Gospel, in this Syriac Codex, it is found that § 421
= chap, xxviii. 8; and § 426 = chap. xxviii. 19, 20:
</p>

<p>
That, in <hi rend="smallcaps">S. Luke's</hi> Gospel,&mdash;§ 390 = chap. xxiv. 8-10:
§ 391 = chap. xxiv. 11; and § 393 = chap. xxiv. 13-17:<note place="foot"><p>Note that
§ 392/9 = S. Luke xxiv. 12: § 394/10 = ver. 18-34: § 395/8 = ver.
35: § 396/9 is incomplete. [Dr. Wright supplies the lacune for me, thus: § 396/9
= ver. 36-41 (down to θαυμαζόντων): § 397/9 = εἶπεν αὐτοῖς down to the end
of ver. 41: § 398/9 = ver. 42: § 399/9 = ver. 43: § 400/10 = ver. 44-50: § 401/8
= 51: § 402/10 = ver. 52, 3.
</p>
<p>
Critical readers will be interested in comparing, or rather contrasting,
the Sectional system of a Syriac MS. with that which prevails in all Greek
Codices. S. John's § 248/1 = xx. 18: his § 249/9 = ver. 19 to εἰρήνη ὑμῖν in
ver. 21: his $ 250/7 = ver. 21 (καθώς to the end of the verse): his § 251/10
= ver. 22: his § 252/7 = ver. 23: his § 253/[10] = ver. 24-5: his § 254/[9] = ver.
26-7: his § 255/10 = ver. 28 to the end of xxi. 4: his § 256/9 = xxi. 5: his § 257/9
= xxi. 6 (to εὑρήσετε): his § 258/9 = ver. 6, (ἔβαλον to the end): his § 259/[10]
= ver. 7, 8: his § 260/[9] = ver. 9: his § 261/[10] = ver. 10: his § 262/9 = ver. 11:
his § 263/9 = first half of ver. 12: his § 264/10 is incomplete.
</p>
<p>
[But Dr. Wright, (remarking that in his MSS., which are evidently the
correcter ones, 263/10 stands opposite the middle of ver. 12 [οὐδεὶς ἐτόλμα], and
264/9 opposite ver. 13 [ἔρχεται οὖν],) proceeds to supply the lacune for me,
thus: § 264/9 = ver. 13: § 265/10 = ver. 14-5 (down to φιλῶ σε; λέγει αυτῷ): § 266/9
= βόσκε τὰ ἀρνία μου, (end of ver. 15): § 267/10 = ver. 16 (down to φιλῶ σε): § 268/9
= λέγει αὐτῷ, Ποίμαινε τὰ πρόβατα μου (end of ver. 16): § 269/10 = ver. 17
(down to φιλῶ σε): § 270/9 = λέγει αὐτῷ ὁ Ἰ., β. τὰ π. μου (end of ver. 17): § 271/10
= ver. 18 to 25.</p></note>
</p>

<p>
That, in <hi rend="smallcaps">S. John's</hi> Gospel,&mdash;§ 247 = chap. xx. 17 (πορεύου
down to Θεὸν ὑμῶν.)

<p>
So that, exhibited in familiar language, these Syriac
<emph>Marginal References</emph> are intended to guide a Reader,
</p>

<p>
(§ 281) From S. Mark xvi. 8,&mdash;to S. Matth. xxviii. 8: S. Luke<lb/>

<p>
Here then, although the Ten Eusebian Canons are faithfully
retained, it is much to be noted that we are presented
with <emph>a different set of Sectional subdivisions</emph>. This will be
best understood by attentively comparing all the details
which precede with the Eusebian references in the inner
margin of a copy of Lloyd's Greek Testament.
</p>

<p>
But the convincing <emph>proof</emph> that these Syriac Sections are
not those with which we have been hitherto acquainted from
Greek MSS., is supplied by the fact that they are so many
<pb n="309"/><anchor id="Pg309"/>
more <emph>in number</emph>. The sum of the Sections in each of the
Gospels follows; for which, (the Bodleian Codex being mutilated,)
I am indebted to the learning and obligingness of
Dr. Wright.<note place="foot"><q>I have examined for your purposes, Add. 14,449;
14,457; 14,458; and 7,157. The first three are Nos. lxix, lxx, and lxxi, in my
own Catalogue: the last, a Nestorian MS., is No. xiii in the old Catalogue of
Forshall and Rosen (London, 1838). All four agree in their numeration.</q></note>
He quotes from <q>the beautiful MS. Addit. 7,157, written
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 768.</q><note place="foot">See the preceding
note.&mdash;Availing myself of the reference given me by my learned correspondent,
I read as follows in the Catalogue:&mdash;<q>Inter ipsa textus verba, numeris
viridi colore pictis, notatur Canon harmoniae Eusebianae, ad quem quaevis sectio
referenda est. Sic, [glyph] [i.e. 1] indicat canonem in quo omnes Evangelistae
concurrunt,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</note> From this, it appears that the
Sections in the Gospel according to,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Matthew</hi>, (instead of being from 359 to 355,)
are 426: (the last Section, § 426/6, consisting of ver. 19, 20.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Mark</hi>, (instead of being from 241 to 233,) are 290:
(the last Section, § 290/8, consisting of ver. 19, 20.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. Luke</hi>, (instead of being from 349 to 342,) are 402:
(the last Section, § 402/10, consisting of ver. 52, 53.)
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">S. John</hi>, (instead of being 232,) is 271: (the last
Section, § 271/10, consisting of ver. 18-25.)

being between 1181 and 1162,<note place="foot">Suidas
[<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 980], by giving 236 to S. Mark and 348 to S. Luke, makes
the sum of the Sections in Greek Evangelia 1,171.</note> is found to be invariably 1389.
</p>

<p>
But here, the question arises,&mdash;Did the Syrian Christians
then retain the Ten Tables, dressing their contents afresh,
so as to adapt them to their own ampler system of sectional
subdivision? or did they merely retain the elementary principle
of referring each Section to one of Ten Canons, but
substitute for the Eusebian Tables a species of harmony, or
apparatus of reference, at the foot of every page?
</p>

<p>
The foregoing doubt is triumphantly resolved by a reference
to Assemani's engraved representation, on xxii Copper
Plates, of the X Eusebian Tables from a superb Syriac Codex
(<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 586) in the Medicean Library.<note place="foot">This
sheet was all but out of the printer's hands when the place in vol. i.

The Syrian Church, therefore, from a period of the remotest
antiquity, not only subdivided the Gospels into a far
greater number of Sections than were in use among the
Greeks, but also habitually employed Eusebian Tables which&mdash;identical
as they are in <emph>appearance</emph> and in <emph>the principle</emph>
of their arrangement with those with which Greek MSS.
have made us familiar,&mdash;yet differ materially from these as
to <emph>the numerical details</emph> of their contents.
</p>

<p>
Let abler men follow up this inquiry to its lawful results.
When the extreme antiquity of the Syriac documents is considered,
may it not almost be made a question whether
Eusebius himself put forth the larger or the smaller number
of Sections? But however <emph>that</emph> may be, more palpably precarious
than ever, I venture to submit, becomes the confident
assertion of the Critics that, <q>just as <hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi> found these
Verses [S. Mark xvi. 9-20] absent in his day from the best
and most numerous [<hi rend='italic'>sic</hi>] copies, <emph>so was also the case
with <hi rend="smallcaps">Ammonius</hi></emph>
when he formed his Harmony in the preceding century.</q><note place="foot">Dr.
Tregelles. (<hi rend='italic'>Vide suprà</hi>, pp. <ref target="Pg125">125-6</ref>.)
And so, Tischendorf.</note>To speak plainly, the statement is purely mythical.
</p>

<p>
VI. Birch [<hi rend='italic'>Varr. Lectt.</hi> p. 226], asserts that in the best
Codices, the Sections of S. Mark's Gospel are not numbered
beyond ch. xvi. 8. Tischendorf prudently adds, <q><emph>or</emph> ver. 9:</q>
<pb n="311"/><anchor id="Pg311"/>
but to introduce <emph>that</emph> alternative is to surrender everything.
I subjoin the result of an appeal to 151 Greek Evangelia.

Twelve Verses, against 37 which close the account at ver. 8,
or sooner. I infer&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>a</hi>) That the reckoning which would
limit the sections to precisely 233, is altogether precarious;
and&mdash;(<hi rend='italic'>b</hi>) That the sum of the Sections assigned to S. Mark's
Gospel by Suidas and by Stephens (viz. 236) is arbitrary.
</p>

<p>
VII. To some, it may not be unacceptable, in conclusion,
to be presented with the very words in which Eusebius explains
how he would have his Sections and Canons used.
His language requires attention. He says:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Εἰ οὖν ἀναπτύξας ἕν τι τῶν τεσσάρων εὐαγγελίων ὁποιονδήποτε,
βουληθείης ἐπιστῆναι τινι ᾧ βούλει κεφαλαίῳ, καὶ
γνῶναι τίνες τὰ παραπλήσια εἰρήκασι, καὶ τοὺς οἰκείους ἐν
<pb n="312"/><anchor id="Pg312"/>
ἑκάστῳ τόπους εὑρεῖν ἐν οἶς κατὰ τῶν αὐτῶν ἠνέχθησαν, ἧς
ἐπέχεις περικοπῆς ἀναλαβὼν τὸν προκείμενον ἀριθμὸν, ἐπιζητήσας
τὲ αὐτὸν ἔνδον ἐν τῷ κανόνι ὄν ἡ διὰ τοῦ κινναβάρεως
ὑποσημείωσις ὑποβέβληκεν, εἴσῃ μὲν εὐθὺς ἐκ τῶν ἐπὶ μετώπου
τοῦ κανόνος προγραφῶν, ὁπόσοι καὶ τίνες τὰ παραπλήσια
εἰρήκασιν; ἐπιστήσας δὲ καὶ τοῖς τῶν λοιπῶν εὐαγγελίων
ἀριθμοῖς τοῖς ἐν τῷ κανόνι ᾧ ἐπέχεις ἀριθμῷ παρακειμένοις,
ἐπιζητήσας τὲ αὐτοὺς ἔνδον ἐν τοῖς οἰκείοις ἑκάστου εὐαγγελίου
τόποις, τὰ παραπλήσια λέγοντας εὑρήσεις.
</p>

<p>
Jerome,&mdash;who is observed sometimes to exhibit the sense
of his author very loosely,&mdash;renders this as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>Cum igitur aperto Codice, verbi gratia, illud sive illud
Capitulum scire volueris cujus Canonis sit, statim ex subjecto
numero doceberis; et recurrens ad principia, in quibus
Canonum est distincta congeries, eodemque statim Canone
ex titulo frontis invento, illum quem quærebas numerum,
ejusdem Evangelistæ, qui et ipse ex inscriptione signatur, invenies;
atque e vicino ceterorum tramitibus inspectis, quos
numeros e regione habeant, annotabis. Et cum scieris, recurres
ad volumina singulorum, et sine mora repertis numeris
quos ante signaveras, reperies et loca in quibus vel
eadem, vel vicina dixerunt.</q>
</p>

<p>
This may be a very masterly way of explaining the use
of the Eusebian Canons. But the points of the original are
missed. What Eusebius actually says is this:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q>If therefore, on opening any one soever of the four Gospels,
thou desirest to study any given Section, and to ascertain
which of the Evangelists have said things of the same kind;
as well as to discover the particular place where each has
been led [to speak] of the same things;&mdash;note the number
of the Section thou art studying, and seek that number in
the Canon indicated by the numeral subscribed in vermilion.
Thou wilt be made aware, at once, from the heading of
each Canon, how many of the Evangelists, and which of
them, have said things of the same kind. Then, by attending
to the parallel numbers relating to the other Gospels in
the same Canon, and by turning to each in its proper place,
thou wilt discover the Evangelists saying things of the
same kind.</q>

It is well known that our two oldest Codices, Cod. B
and Cod. א, (see above, p. <ref target="Pg080">80</ref>,) exhibit S. Matthew xxvii. 49,
as follows. After σωσων [<hi rend='italic'>Cod. Sinait.</hi> σωσαι] αυτον, they
read:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<hi rend="smallcaps">(Cod. B.)</hi><lb/>

<p>
Then comes, ο δε ΙΣ παλιν κραξας κ.τ.λ. The same is
also the reading of Codd. C, L, U, Γ: and it is known to
recur in the following cursives,&mdash;5, 48, 67, 115, 127.<note place="foot">But Cod.
U inserts ευθεως before εξηλθεν; and (at least two of the other Codices, viz.) 48,
67 read αιμα και υσωρ.</note>
</p>

<p>
Obvious is it to suspect with Matthaei, (ed. 1803, vol. i.
p. 158,) that it was the Lectionary practice of the Oriental
Church which occasioned this interpolation. In S. John
xix. 34 occurs the well-known record,&mdash;ἀλλ᾽ εἶς τῶν στρατιωτῶν
λόγχῃ αὐτοῦ τὴν πλευρὰν ἔνυξε, καὶ εὐθὺς ἐξῆλθεν
αἷμα καὶ ὕδωρ: and it was the established practice of the
Easterns, in the Ecclesiastical lection for Good Friday,
(viz. S. Matth. xxvii. 1-61,) <emph>to interpose S. John</emph> xix. 31
<emph>to</emph> 37 between the 54th and the 55th verses of S. Matthew.
This will be found alluded to above, at p. <ref target="Pg202">202</ref> and again at
pp. <ref target="Pg218">218-9</ref>.

After the pages just quoted were in type, while examining
Harl. MS. 5647 in the British Museum, (<emph>our</emph> Evan. 72,) I
alighted on the following Scholion, which I have since
found that Wetstein duly published; but which has certainly
not attracted the attention it deserves, and which is
incorrectly represented as referring to the end of S. Matth.
xxvii. 49. It is <emph>against ver.</emph> 48 that there is written in the
margin,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
(Η<note place="foot">Σημείωσις is what we call an <q>Annotation.</q> [On the sign in the

of Huet, <hi rend='italic'>Origeniana</hi>, iii. § i. 4. (at the end of vol. iv. of

This writer is perfectly correct in his statement. In
Chrysostom's 88th Homily on S. Matthew's Gospel, (<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi>
vii, 825 <hi rend="smallcaps">c</hi>: [vol. ii, p. 526, <hi rend='italic'>ed.</hi>
Field.]) is read as follows:&mdash;Ἐνόμισαν
Ἠλίαν εἶναι, φησὶ, τὸν καλούμενον, καὶ εὐθέως
ἐπότισαν αὐτὸν ὄξος: (which is clearly meant to be a summary
of the contents <emph>of ver.</emph> 48: then follows) ἕτερος δὲ προσελθών
λόγχῃ αὐτοῦ τῆν πλευρὰν ἔνυξε. (Chrysostom quotes
no further, but proceeds,&mdash;Τί γένοιτ ἄν τούτων παρανομώτερον,
τί δὲ θηριωδέστερον, κ.τ.λ.)
</p>

<p>
I find it impossible on a review of the evidence to adhere
to the opinion I once held, and have partially expressed
above, (viz. at p. <ref target="Pg202">202</ref>,) that the Lectionary-practice of the
Eastern Church was the occasion of this corrupt reading in
our two oldest uncials. A corrupt reading it undeniably is;
and the discredit of exhibiting it, Codd. B, א, (not to say Codd.
<pb n="315"/><anchor id="Pg315"/>
C, L, U, Γ,) must continue to sustain. That Chrysostom
and Cyril also employed Codices disfigured by this self-same
blemish, is certain. It is an interesting and suggestive circumstance.
Nor is this all. Severus<note place="foot">He was Patriarch of Antioch,
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 512-9.&mdash;The extract (made by Petrus junior,
Monophysite Patriarch of Antioch, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 578,) purports to be
derived from the 26<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> Epistle, (Book 9,) which
Severus addressed to Thomas Bp. of Germanicia after his exile. See Assemani,
<hi rend='italic'>Bibl. Orient.</hi> vol. ii. pp. 81-2.</note> relates that between
<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 496 and 511, being at Constantinople, he had known
this very reading strenuously discussed: whereupon had been
produced a splendid copy of S. Matthew's Gospel, traditionally
said to have been found with the body of the Apostle
Barnabas in the Island of Cyprus in the time of the Emperor
Zeno (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 474-491); and preserved in the palace
with superstitious veneration in consequence. It contained
no record of the piercing of the <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> side: nor (adds
Severus) does any ancient Interpreter mention the transaction
in that place,&mdash;except Chrysostom and <emph>Cyril of Alexandria</emph>;
into whose Commentaries it has found its way.&mdash;Thus,
to Codices B, א, C and the copy familiarly employed
by Chrysostom, has to be added the copy which Cyril of
Alexandria<note place="foot">I cannot find the place in Cyril. I suppose it occurs in
a lost Commentary of this Father,&mdash;whose Works by the way are miserably
indexed.</note> employed; as well as evidently sundry other
Codices extant at Constantinople about <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 500. That the
corruption of the text of S. Matthew's Gospel under review
is ancient therefore, and was once very widely spread, is
certain. The question remains,&mdash;and this is the only point
to be determined,&mdash;How did it <emph>originate</emph>?
</p>

<p>
Now it must be candidly admitted, that if the strange
method of the Lectionaries already explained, (viz. of interposing
seven verses of S. John's xix<hi rend="vertical-align: super">th</hi> chapter [ver. 31-7]
between the 54th and 55th verses of S. Matth. xxvii,) really
were the occasion of this interpolation of S. John xix. 34
after S. Matth. xxvii. 48 or 49,&mdash;two points would seem to
call for explanation which at present remain unexplained:
First, (1) Why does <emph>only that one verse</emph> find place in the interpolated
copies? And next, (2) How does it come to pass
<pb n="316"/><anchor id="Pg316"/>
that <emph>that</emph> one verse is exhibited in so very depraved and so
peculiar a form?
</p>

<p>
For, to say nothing of the inverted order of the two
principal words, (which is clearly due to 1 S. John v. 6,)
let it be carefully noted that the substitution of ἄλλος δὲ
λαβών λόγχην, for ἀλλ᾽ εἶς τῶν στρατιωτῶν λόγχῃ of the
Evangelist, is a tell-tale circumstance. The turn thus licentiously
given to the narrative clearly proceeded from
some one who was bent on weaving incidents related by
different writers into a connected narrative, and who was
sometimes constrained to take liberties with his Text in
consequence. (Thus, S. Matthew having supplied the fact
that <q><hi rend="smallcaps">ONE OF THEM</hi> ran, and <emph>took a sponge</emph>,
and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink,</q>
S. John is made to say, <q><hi rend="smallcaps">And another</hi>&mdash;<emph>took a
spear</emph>.</q>)
Now, this is exactly what Tatian is related by Eusebius to
have done: viz. <q>after some fashion of his own, to have composed
out of the four Gospels one connected narrative.</q><note place="foot">Ὁ μέντοι γε
πρότερος αὐτῶν [viz. the sect of the Severiani] ἀρχηγὸς ὁ
Τατιανὸς συνάφειάν τινα καὶ συναγωγὴν οὐκ οἶδ᾽ ὅπως τῶν εὐαγγελίων συνθεὶς, τὸ
διὰ τεσσάρων τοῦτο προσωνόμασεν. Ὁ καὶ παρά τισιν εἰσέτι νῦν φέρεται. The
next words are every way suggestive. Τοῦ δὲ ἀποστόλου φασὶ τολμῆσαί τινας
αὐτὸν μεταφράσαι φωνὰς, ὡς ἐπιδιωρθούμενον αὐτῶν τὴν τῆς φράσεως
σύνταξιν.&mdash;Eusebius, <hi rend='italic'>Hist. Eccl.</hi> iv. 29, § 4.</note>
</p>

<p>
When therefore, (as in the present Scholion,) an ancient
Critic who appears to have been familiarly acquainted with
the lost <q>Diatessaron</q> of Tatian, comes before us with the
express declaration that in that famous monument of the
primitive age (<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 173), S. John's record of the piercing
of our <hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi> side was thrust into S. Matthew's History
of the Passion in this precise way and in these very terms,&mdash;(for,
<q>Note,</q> he says, <q>That into the Evangelical History
of Diodorus, of Tatian, and of divers other holy Fathers,
is introduced [here] the following addition: <q>And another
took a spear and pierced His side, and there came out Water
and Blood.</q> This, Chrysostom also says</q>),&mdash;it is even unreasonable
to seek for any other explanation of the vitiated
text of our two oldest Codices. Not only is the testimony
to the critical fact abundantly sufficient, but the proposed
solution of the difficulty, in itself the reverse of improbable,
<pb n="317"/><anchor id="Pg317"/>
is in the highest degree suggestive as well as important.
For,&mdash;May we not venture to opine that the same καθ᾽ ἱστορίαν
εὐαγγέλιον,&mdash;as this Writer aptly designates Tatian's
work,&mdash;is responsible for not a few of the <hi rend='italic'>monstra potius
quam variae lectiones</hi><note place="foot">See, for example, the readings of B
or א, or both, specified from p. <ref target="Pg080">80</ref> to p. 86.</note>
which are occasionally met with in
the earliest MSS. of all? And,&mdash;Am I not right in suggesting
that the circumstance before us is <emph>the only thing
we know for certain</emph> about the text of Tatian's (miscalled)
<q>Harmony?</q>
</p>

<p>
To conclude.&mdash;That the <q>Diatessaron</q> of Tatian, (for so,
according to Eusebius and Theodoret, Tatian himself styled
it,) has long since disappeared, no one now
doubts.<note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Vid. suprà</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg129">129</ref>, note (g.)</note> That
Eusebius himself, (who lived 150 years after the probable
date of its composition,) had never seen it, may I suppose be
inferred from the terms in which he speaks of it. Jerome
does not so much as mention its existence. Epiphanius,
who is very full and particular concerning the heresy of
Tatian, affords no indication that he was acquainted with
his work. On the contrary. <q>The Diatessaron Gospel,</q>
(he remarks in passing,) <q>which some call the Gospel according
to the Hebrews, is said to have been the production
of this writer.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. i. p. 391
<hi rend="smallcaps">D</hi>.</note> The most interesting notice we have of
Tatian's work is from the pen of Theodoret. After explaining
that Tatian the Syrian, originally a Sophist, and next
a disciple of Justin Martyr [<hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 150], after Justin's death
aspired to being a heretical leader,&mdash;(statements which are
first found in Irenæus,)&mdash;Theodoret enumerates his special
tenets. <q>This man</q> (he proceeds) <q>put together the so-called
<emph>Diatessaron Gospel</emph>,&mdash;from which he cut away the
genealogies, and whatever else shews that the <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord</hi> was
born of the seed of David. The book was used not only by
those who favoured Tatian's opinions, but by the orthodox
as well; who, unaware of the mischievous spirit in which
the work had been executed, in their simplicity used the
book as an epitome. <emph>I myself found upwards of two hundred
such copies honourably preserved in the Churches of this place</emph>,</q>
(Cyrus in Syria namely, of which Theodoret was made
<pb n="318"/><anchor id="Pg318"/>
Bishop, <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 423,)&mdash;<q>all of which I
collected together, and
put aside; substituting the Gospels of the Four Evangelists
in their room.</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Haeret. Fab.</hi> lib. i. c.

Parishes.<note place="foot">Clinton, F. R. ii. <hi rend='italic'>Appendix</hi>, p.
473, quoting Theodoret's <q>Ep. 113, p. 1190. [<hi rend='italic'>al.</hi> vol.
iii. p. 986-7].</q></note> It cannot be thought surprising that a work of
which copies had been multiplied to such an extraordinary
extent, and which was evidently once held in high esteem,
should have had <emph>some</emph> influence on the text of the earliest
Codices; and here, side by side with a categorical statement
as to one of its licentious interpolations, we are furnished
with documentary proof that many an early MS. also was
infected with the same taint. To assume that the two phenomena
stand related to one another in the way of cause
and effect, seems to be even an inevitable proceeding.
</p>

<p>
I will not prolong this note by inquiring concerning the
<q>Diodorus</q> of whom the unknown author of this scholion
speaks: but I suppose it was <emph>that</emph> Diodorus who was made
Bishop of Tarsus in <hi rend="smallcaps">A.D.</hi> 378. He is related to have been
the preceptor of Chrysostom; was a very voluminous writer;
and, among the rest, according to Suidas, wrote a work <q>on
the Four Gospels.</q>
</p>

<p>
Lastly,&mdash;How about the singular introduction <emph>into the
Lection for Good-Friday</emph> of this incident of the piercing of
the <hi rend="smallcaps">Redeemer's</hi> side? Is it allowable to conjecture that,
indirectly, the Diatessaron of Tatian may have been the
occasion of that circumstance also; as well as of certain
other similar phenomena in the Evangeliaria?

<p>
(<hi rend="smallcaps">Promised at</hi> p. <ref target="Pg051">51</ref>.)
</p>

<p>
I proceed to fulfil the promise made at p. 51.&mdash;C.F. Matthaei
(<hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi>, 1788, vol. iii. p. 269) states that in one of
the MSS. at Moscow occurs the following <q>Scholion of
<hi rend="smallcaps">Eusebius</hi>:&mdash;κατὰ
Μάρκον μετὰ τῆν ἀνάστασιν οὐ λέγεται ὤφθαι
τοῖς μαθηταῖς.</q> On this, Griesbach remarks (<hi rend='italic'>Comm. Crit.</hi> ii.
200),&mdash;<q>quod scribere non potuisset si pericopam dubiam
agnovisset:</q> the record in S. Mark xvi. 14, being express,&mdash;Ὕστερον
ἀνακειμένοις αὐτοῖς τοῖς ἕνδεκα ἐφανερώθη. The
epigrammatic smartness of Griesbach's dictum has recommended
it to Dr. Tregelles and others who look unfavourably
on the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel; and to this hour the
Scholion of Matthaei remains unchallenged.
</p>

<p>
But to accept the proposed inference from it, is impossible.
It ought to be obvious to every thoughtful person
that problems of this class will not bear to be so handled.
It is as if one were to apply the rigid mathematical method
to the ordinary transactions of daily life, for which
it is clearly unsuitable. Before we move a single step,
however, we desire a few more particulars concerning this
supposed evidence of Eusebius.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, I invoked the good offices of my friend, the
Rev. W. G. Penny, English Chaplain at Moscow, to obtain
for me <emph>the entire context</emph> in which this <q>Scholion of Eusebius</q>
occurs: little anticipating the trouble I was about to give
him. His task would have been comparatively easy had
I been able to furnish him (which I was not) with the exact
designation of the Codex required. At last by sheer determination
and the display of no small ability, he discovered
the place, and sent me a tracing of the whole page: viz. fol.
286 (the last ten words being overleaf) of Matthaei's <q>12,</q>
(<q>Synod. 139,</q>) our <hi rend="smallcaps">Evan.</hi> 255.
</p>

<p>
It proves to be the concluding portion of Victor's Commentary,
and to correspond with what is found at p. 365 of
<pb n="320"/><anchor id="Pg320"/>
Possinus, and p. 446-7 of Cramer: except that after the
words <q>ἀποκυλίσειε τὸν λίθον,</q> and before the words
<q>ἄλλος δέ φησιν</q> [Possinus, <emph>line</emph> 12 <emph>from bottom</emph>: Cramer,
<emph>line</emph> 3 <emph>from the top</emph>], is read as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
οχολ εὐσεβίου
</p>

<p>
κατὰ Μάρκον: μετὰ τὴν ἀνάστασιν οὐ λέγεται ὦφθαι
τοῖς μαθηταῖς: κατὰ Ματθαῖον: μετὰ τὴν ἀνάστασιν τοῖς
μαθηταῖς ὤφθη ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ.
</p>

<p>
κατὰ Ἰωάννην: ἐν αὐτῇ τῇ ἡμέρᾳ τῆς ἀναστάσεως τῶν
θυρῶν κεκλεισμένων ὁ Ἰησοῦς μέσος τῶν μαθητῶν μὴ
παρόντος τοῦ Θωμᾶ ἔστη; καὶ μεθ᾽ ἡμέρας πάλιν ὀκτὼ

μαθητῶν: καὶ ὤφθη Σίμωνι: καὶ πάλιν ἐξήγαγεν αὐτοὺς
εἰς Βηθανίαν καὶ διέστη ἀπ᾽ αὐτῶν.
</p>

<p>
But surely no one who considers the matter attentively,
will conceive that he is warranted in drawing from this so
serious an inference as that Eusebius disallowed the last
Section of S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p>
(1.) In the first place, we have already [<hi rend='italic'>suprà</hi>, p.
<ref target="Pg044">44</ref>] heard Eusebius elaborately discuss the Section in question.
That he allowed it, is therefore <emph>certain</emph>.
</p>

<p>
(2.) But next, this σχόλιον εὐσεβίου at the utmost can
only be regarded as a general summary of what Eusebius
has somewhere delivered concerning our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> appearances
after His Resurrection. <emph>As it stands</emph>, it clearly is not the
work of Eusebius.
</p>

<p>
(3.) And because I shall be reminded that such a statement
cannot be accepted on my own mere <q>ipse dixit,</q> I
proceed to subjoin the original Scholion of which the preceding
is evidently only an epitome. It is found in three
of the Moscow MSS., (our Evan. 239, 259, 237,) but without
any Author's name:&mdash;

<p>
(4.) Now, the chief thing deserving of attention here,&mdash;the
<emph>only</emph> thing in fact which I am concerned to point out,&mdash;is
the notable circumstance that the supposed dictum of
Eusebius,&mdash;(<q>quod scribere non potuisset si pericopam dubiam
agnovisset,</q>)&mdash;<emph>is no longer discoverable</emph>. To say that
<q>it has disappeared,</q> would be incorrect. In the original
document <emph>it has no existence</emph>. In plain terms, the famous
<q>σχόλιον εὐσεβίου</q> proves to be every way a figment. It
is a worthless interpolation, thrust by some nameless scribe
into his abridgement of a Scholion, of which Eusebius (as
I shall presently shew) <emph>cannot</emph> have been the Author.
</p>

<p>
(5.) I may as well point out <emph>why</emph> the person who wrote
the longer Scholion says nothing about S. Mark's Gospel.
It is because there was nothing for him to say.
<pb n="322"/><anchor id="Pg322"/>
He is enumerating our <hi rend="smallcaps">Lord's</hi> <emph>appearances to His
Disciples</emph> after His Resurrection; and he discovers that these
were exactly seven in number: <emph>one</emph> being peculiar to S.
Matthew,&mdash;<emph>three</emph>, to S. John,&mdash;<emph>three</emph>, to S.
Luke. But because, (as every one is aware), there exists <emph>no</emph>
record of an appearance to the Disciples <emph>peculiar</emph> to S. Mark's Gospel,
the Author of the Scholion is silent concerning S. Mark <emph>perforce</emph>....
How so acute and accomplished a Critic as Matthaei
can have overlooked all this: how he can have failed to recognise
the identity of his longer and his shorter Scholion:
how he came to say of the latter, <q>conjicias ergo Eusebium
hunc totum locum repudiasse;</q> and, of the former, <q>ultimam
partem Evangelii Marci videtur
tollere:</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Ibid</hi>., ii. 69, and ix. 228.</note>
lastly, how Tischendorf (1869) can write,&mdash;<q>est enim ejusmodi ut
ultimam partem evangelii Marci, de quo quaeritur,
excludat:</q><note place="foot"><hi rend='italic'>Nov. Test.</hi> (1869), p.
404.</note>&mdash;I profess myself unable to understand.
</p>

<p>
(6.) The epitomizer however, missing the point of his
Author,&mdash;besides enumerating <emph>all</emph> the appearances of our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour</hi> which S. Luke anywhere records,&mdash;is further
convicted of having injudiciously <emph>invented</emph> the negative statement
about S. Mark's Gospel which is occasioning us all
this trouble.
</p>

<p>
(7.) And yet, by that unlucky sentence of his, he certainly
did not mean what is commonly imagined. I am not concerned
to defend him: but it is only fair to point out that,
to suppose he intended <emph>to disallow the end of S. Mark's Gospel</emph>,
is altogether to misapprehend the gist of his remarks, and
to impute to him a purpose of which he clearly knew nothing.
Note, how he throws his first two statements into
a separate paragraph; contrasts, and evidently <emph>balances</emph> one
against the other: thus,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
κατὰ Μάρκον, μετὰ τὴν ἀνάστασιν οὐ λέγεται ὤφθαι,&mdash;κατὰ
Ματθαῖον μετὰ τὴν ἀνάστασιν ὤφθη,&mdash;τοῖς μαθηταῖς
ἐν τῇ Γαλιλαίᾳ.
</p>

<p>
Perfectly evident is it that the <q>plena locutio</q> so to speak,
of the Writer would have been somewhat as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">[The first two Evangelists are engaged with our
<hi rend="smallcaps">Saviour's</hi>
appearance to His Disciples <emph>in Galilee</emph>: but] by
<pb n="323"/><anchor id="Pg323"/>
S. Mark, He is <emph>not</emph>&mdash;by S. Matthew, He <emph>is</emph>&mdash;related
to have been actually <emph>seen</emph> by them there.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q rend="pre">[The other two Evangelists relate the appearances <emph>in
Jerusalem</emph>: and] according to S. John, &amp;c. &amp;c.</q>
</p>

<p>
<q>According to S. Luke,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
(8.) And on passing the <q>Quaestiones ad Marinum</q>
of Eusebius under review, I am constrained to admit that
the Scholion before us is just such a clumsy bit of writing
as an unskilful person might easily be betrayed into, who
should attempt to exhibit in a few short sentences the substance
of more than one tedious disquisition of this ancient
Father.<note place="foot">Let the reader examine his <q>Quaestio ix,</q> (Mai, vol.
iv. p. 293-5): his <q>Quaestio x,</q> (p. 295, last seven lines). See also p. 296,
line 29-32.</note> Its remote parentage would fully account for its
being designated <q>σχόλιον εὐσεβίου</q> all the same.
</p>

<p>
(9.) Least of all am I concerned to say anything more
about the longer Scholion; seeing that S. Mark is not so
much as mentioned in it. But I may as well point out that,
<emph>as it stands</emph>, Eusebius cannot have been its Author: the
proof being, that whereas the Scholion in question is a note
on S. John xxi. 12, (as Matthaei is careful to inform us,)&mdash;its
opening sentence is derived <emph>from Chrysostom's Commentary
on that same verse</emph> in his 87th Homily on S. John.<note place="foot">See Chrys.
<hi rend='italic'>Opp.</hi> vol. viii. p. 522
<hi rend='italic'>c</hi>:&mdash;ὅτι δὲ οὐδὲ συνεχῶς ἐπεχωρίαζεν, οὐδὲ
ὁμοίως, λέγει ὅτι τρίτον τοῦτο ἐφάνη αὐτοῖς, ὅτε ἐγέρθη ἐκ νεκρῶν.</note>
</p>

<p>
(10.) And thus, one by one, every imposing statement of
the Critics is observed hopelessly to collapse as soon as it
is questioned, and to vanish into thin air.
</p>

<p>
So much has been offered, only because of the deliberate
pledge I gave in p. <ref target="Pg051">51</ref>.&mdash;Never again, I undertake to say,
will the <q>Scholion of Eusebius</q> which has cost my friend
at Moscow, his Archimandrites, and me, so much trouble, be
introduced into any discussion of the genuineness of the last
Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark. As the
oversight of one (C. F. Matthaei) who was singularly accurate,
and towards whom we must all feel as towards a Benefactor,
let it be freely forgiven as well as loyally forgotten!

<l>As one, escaped the bustling trafficking town,</l>
<l>Worn out and weary, climbs his favourite hill</l>
<l>And thinks it Heaven to see the calm green fields</l>
<l>Mapped out in beautiful sunlight at his feet:</l>
<l>Or walks enraptured where the fitful south</l>
<l>Comes past the beans in blossom; and no sight</l>
<l>Or scent or sound but fills his soul with glee:&mdash;</l>
<l>So I,&mdash;rejoicing once again to stand</l>
<l>Where Siloa's brook flows softly, and the meads</l>
<l>Are all enamell'd o'er with deathless flowers,</l>
<l>And Angel voices fill the dewy air.</l>
<l>Strife is so hateful to me! most of all</l>
<l>A strife of words about the things of <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>.</l>
<l>Better by far the peasant's uncouth speech</l>
<l>Meant for the heart's confession of its hope.</l>
<l>Sweeter by far in village-school the words</l>
<l>But half remembered from the Book of Life,</l>
<l>Or scarce articulate lispings of the Creed.</l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>And yet, three times that miracle of Spring</l>
<l>The grand old tree that darkens Exeter wall</l>
<l>Hath decked itself with blossoms as with stars,</l>
<l>Since I, like one that striveth unto death,</l>
<l>Find myself early and late and oft all day</l>
<l>Engaged in eager conflict for <hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Truth;</l>
<l><hi rend="smallcaps">God's</hi> Truth, to be maintained against Man's lie.</l>
<l>And lo, my brook which widened out long since</l>
<l>Into a river, threatens now at length</l>
<l>To burst its channel and become a sea.</l>
</lg>

<pb n="325"/><anchor id="Pg325"/>

<lg>
<l>O Sister, who ere yet my task is done</l>
<l>Art lying (my loved Sister!) in thy shroud</l>
<l>With a calm placid smile upon thy lips</l>
<l>As thou wert only <q>taking of rest in sleep,</q></l>
<l>Soon to wake up to ministries of love,&mdash;</l>
<l>Open those lips, kind Sister, for my sake</l>
<l>In the mysterious place of thy sojourn,</l>
<l>(For thou must needs be with the bless'd,&mdash;yea, where</l>
<l>The pure in heart draw wondrous nigh to <hi rend="smallcaps">God</hi>,)</l>
<l>And tell the Evangelist of thy brother's toil;</l>
<l>Adding (be sure!) <q rend="pre">He found it his reward,</q></l>
<l>Yet supplicates thy blessing and thy prayers,</l>
<l>The blessing, saintly Stranger, of thy prayers,</l>
<l><q rend="post">Sure at the least unceasingly of mine!</q></l>
</lg>

<lg>
<l>One other landed on the eternal shore!</l>
<l>One other garnered into perfect peace!</l>
<l>One other hid from hearing and from sight!...</l>
<l>O but the days go heavily, and the toil</l>
<l>Which used to seem so pleasant yields scant joy.</l>
<l>There come no tokens to us from the dead:</l>
<l>Save&mdash;it may be&mdash;that now and then we reap</l>
<l>Where not we sowed, and <emph>that</emph> may be from <emph>them</emph>,</l>
<l>Fruit of their prayers when we forgot to pray!</l>
<l>Meantime there comes no message, comes no word:</l>
<l>Day after day no message and no sign:</l>
<l>And the heart droops, and finds that it was Love</l>
<l>Not Fame it longed for, lived for: only Love.</l>
