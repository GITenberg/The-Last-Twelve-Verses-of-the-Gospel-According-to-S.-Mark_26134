On the next page is exhibited an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">exact Fac-simile</span></span>, obtained
by Photography, of fol. 28 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span> of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex
Sinaiticus</span></span> at S. Petersburg, (Tischendorf's ◊ê): shewing the abrupt termination
of S. Mark's Gospel at the words ŒïŒ¶ŒüŒíŒüŒ•ŒùŒ§Œü ŒìŒëŒ°
(chap. xvi. 8), as explained at p. <a href="#Pg070" class="tei tei-ref">70</a>, and pp.
<a href="#Pg086" class="tei tei-ref">86-8</a>. The
original Photograph, which is here reproduced on a diminished
scale, measures in height full fourteen inches and
one-eighth; in breadth, full thirteen inches. It was procured
for me through the friendly and zealous offices of the
English Chaplain at S. Petersburg, the Rev. A. S. Thompson,
B.D.; by favour of the Keeper of the Imperial Library, who
has my hearty thanks for his liberality and consideration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be perceived that the text begins at S. Mark xvi. 2,
and ends with the first words of S. Luke i. 18.

Up to this hour, every endeavour to obtain a Photograph
of the corresponding page of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex Vaticanus</span></span>, B,
(No. 1209, in the Vatican,) has proved unavailing. If the
present Vindication of the genuineness of Twelve Verses of
the everlasting Gospel should have the good fortune to approve
itself to his Holiness, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Pope Pius IX.</span></span>, let me be permitted
in this unadorned and unusual manner,‚Äî(to which
I would fain add some circumstance of respectful ceremony
if I knew how,)‚Äîvery humbly to entreat his Holiness to
allow me to possess a Photograph, corresponding in size
with the original, of the page of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Codex B</span></span> (it is numbered
fol. 1303,) which exhibits the abrupt termination of the
Gospel according to S. Mark.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Dear Sir Roundell</span></span>,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do myself the honour of inscribing this volume to you. Permit
me to explain the reason why.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not merely that I may give expression to a sentiment of
private friendship which dates back from the pleasant time when
I was Curate to your Father,‚Äîwhose memory I never recall
without love and veneration;‚Äînor even in order to afford myself
the opportunity of testifying how much I honour you for the
noble example of conscientious uprightness and integrity which
you set us on a recent public occasion. It is for no such reason
that I dedicate to you this vindication of the last Twelve Verses
of the Gospel according to S. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is because I desire supremely to submit the argument contained
in the ensuing pages to a practised judicial intellect of the
loftiest stamp. Recent Editors of the New Testament insist that
these <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlast Twelve Verses‚Äù</span> are not genuine. The Critics, almost
to a man, avow themselves of the same opinion. Popular Prejudice
has been for a long time past warmly enlisted on the same side.
I am as convinced as I am of my life, that the reverse is the
truth. It is not even with me as it is with certain learned
friends of mine, who, admitting the adversary's premisses, content
themselves with denying the validity of his inference. However
true it may be,‚Äîand it is true,‚Äîthat from those premisses
the proposed conclusion does not follow, I yet venture to deny the
correctness of those premisses altogether. I insist, on the contrary,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagevi">[pg vi]</span><a name="Pgvi" id="Pgvi" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the Evidence relied on is untrustworthy,‚Äîuntrustworthy
in every particular.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How, in the meantime, can such an one as I am hope to
persuade the world that it is as I say, while the most illustrious
Biblical Critics at home and abroad are agreed, and against me?
Clearly, the first thing to be done is to secure for myself a full
and patient hearing. With this view, I have written a book.
But next, instead of waiting for the slow verdict of Public
Opinion, (which yet, I know, must come after many days,) I
desiderate for the Evidence I have collected, a competent and an
impartial Judge. And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is why I dedicate my book to you.
If I can but get this case fairly tried, I have no doubt whatever
about the result.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whether you are able to find time to read these pages, or not,
it shall content me to have shewn in this manner the confidence
with which I advocate my cause; the kind of test to which I
propose to bring my reasonings. If I may be allowed to say so,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark's
last Twelve Verses shall no longer remain a
subject of dispute among men.</span></em> I am able to prove that
this portion of the Gospel has been declared to be spurious on
wholly mistaken grounds: and this ought in fairness to close
the discussion. But I claim to have done more. I claim to have
shewn, from considerations which have been hitherto overlooked,
that its genuineness must needs be reckoned among the things
that are absolutely certain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am, with sincere regard and respect,<br />
Dear Sir Roundell,<br />
Very faithfully yours,<br />
JOHN W. BURGON.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This volume is my contribution towards the better
understanding of a subject which is destined,
when it shall have grown into a Science, to vindicate
for itself a mighty province, and to enjoy paramount
attention. I allude to the Textual Criticism
of the New Testament Scriptures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
That this Study is still in its infancy, all may see.
The very principles on which it is based are as yet
only imperfectly understood. The reason is obvious.
It is because the very foundations have not yet been
laid, (except to a wholly inadequate extent,) on which
the future superstructure is to rise. A careful collation
of every extant Codex, (executed after the manner
of the Rev. F. H. Scrivener's labours in this department,)
is the first indispensable preliminary to
any real progress. Another, is a revised Text, not to
say a more exact knowledge, of the oldest Versions.
Scarcely of inferior importance would be critically
correct editions of the Fathers of the Church; and
these must by all means be furnished with far completer
Indices of Texts than have ever yet been attempted.‚ÄîThere
is not a single Father to be named
whose Works have been hitherto furnished with even
a tolerably complete Index of the places in which he
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageviii">[pg viii]</span><a name="Pgviii" id="Pgviii" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
either quotes, or else clearly refers to, the Text of the
New Testament: while scarcely a tithe of the known
MSS. of the Gospels have as yet been satisfactorily
collated. Strange to relate, we are to this hour without
so much as a satisfactory Catalogue of the Copies
which are known to be extant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when all this has been done,‚Äî(and the Science
deserves, and requires, a little more public encouragement
than has hitherto been bestowed on the arduous
and‚Äîlet me not be ashamed to add the word‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unremunerative</span></em>
labour of Textual Criticism,)‚Äîit will be
discovered that the popular and the prevailing Theory
is a mistaken one. The plausible hypothesis on which
recent recensions of the Text have been for the most
part conducted, will be seen to be no longer tenable.
The latest decisions will in consequence be generally
reversed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am not of course losing sight of what has been
already achieved in this department of Sacred Learning.
While our knowledge of the uncial MSS. has been
rendered tolerably exact and complete, an excellent
beginning has been made, (chiefly by the Rev.
F. H. Scrivener, the most judicious living Master
of Textual Criticism,) in acquainting us with the contents
of about seventy of the cursive MSS. of the New
Testament. And though it is impossible to deny that
the published Texts of Doctors Tischendorf and Tregelles
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Texts</span></em> are wholly inadmissible, yet is it
equally certain that by the conscientious diligence
with which those distinguished Scholars have respectively
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pageix">[pg ix]</span><a name="Pgix" id="Pgix" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
laboured, they have erected monuments of their
learning and ability which will endure for ever. Their
Editions of the New Testament will not be superseded
by any new discoveries, by any future advances
in the Science of Textual Criticism. The MSS. which
they have edited will remain among the most precious
materials for future study. All honour to them!
If in the warmth of controversy I shall appear to
have spoken of them sometimes without becoming
deference, let me here once for all confess that I am
to blame, and express my regret. When they have
publicly begged S. Mark's pardon for the grievous
wrong they have done <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">him</span></em>, I will very humbly beg
their pardon also.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In conclusion, I desire to offer my thanks to the
Rev. John Wordsworth, late Fellow of Brasenose College,
for his patient perusal of these sheets as they
have passed through the press, and for favouring me
with several judicious suggestions. To him may be
applied the saying of President Routh on receiving
a visit from Bishop Wordsworth at his lodgings,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI
see the learned son of a learned Father, sir!‚Äù</span>‚ÄîLet
me be permitted to add that my friend inherits
the Bishop's fine taste and accurate judgment also.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And now I dismiss this Work, at which I have
conscientiously laboured for many days and many
nights; beginning it in joy and ending it in sorrow.
The College in which I have for the most part written
it is designated in the preamble of its Charter and
in its Foundation Statutes, (which are already much
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="pagex">[pg x]</span><a name="Pgx" id="Pgx" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
more than half a thousand years old,) as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Collegium

temporibus duraturum</span></span>. Indebted, under <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, to the
pious munificence of the Founder of Oriel for my
opportunities of study, I venture, in what I must
needs call evil days, to hope that I have to some
extent <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúemployed my advantages,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(the expression
occurs in a prayer used by this Society on its
three solemn anniversaries,)‚Äîas our Founder and
Benefactors <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwould approve if they were now upon
earth to witness what we do.‚Äù</span>

It has lately become the fashion to speak of the last Twelve

But I hope that I shall succeed in doing more. It shall
be my endeavour to shew not only that there really is no
reason whatever for calling in question the genuineness of
this portion of Holy Writ, but also that there exist sufficient
reasons for feeling confident that it must needs be
genuine. This is clearly as much as it is possible for me
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page002">[pg 002]</span><a name="Pg002" id="Pg002" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to achieve. But when this has been done, I venture to hope
that the verses in dispute will for the future be allowed to
retain their place in the second Gospel unmolested.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will of course be asked,‚ÄîAnd yet, if all this be so,
how does it happen that both in very ancient, and also in
very modern times, this proposal to suppress twelve verses
of the Gospel has enjoyed a certain amount of popularity?
At the two different periods, (I answer,) for widely different
reasons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) In the ancient days, when it was the universal belief
of Christendom that the Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> must needs be consistent
with itself in every part, and prove in every part
(like its Divine Author) perfectly <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfaithful and true,‚Äù</span> the
difficulty (which was deemed all but insuperable) of bringing
certain statements in S. Mark's last Twelve Verses into
harmony with certain statements of the other Evangelists,
is discovered to have troubled Divines exceedingly. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn
fact,‚Äù</span> (says Mr. Scrivener,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúit brought suspicion upon these
verses, and caused their omission in some copies seen by
Eusebius.‚Äù</span> That the maiming process is indeed attributable
to this cause and came about in this particular way, I am
unable to persuade myself; but, if the desire to provide an
escape from a serious critical difficulty did not actually
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasion</span></em> that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were mutilated, it
certainly was the reason why, in very early times, such
mutilated copies were viewed without displeasure by some,
and appealed to with complacency by others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) But times are changed. We have recently been
assured on high authority that the Church has reversed her
ancient convictions in this respect: that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmost sound
theologians have no dread whatever of acknowledging minute
points of disagreement‚Äù</span> (i.e. minute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">errors</span></em>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin the fourfold
narrative even of the life of the Redeemer.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_1" name="noteref_1" href="#note_1"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">1</span></span></a>
There has arisen in these last days a singular impatience of Dogmatic
Truth, (especially Dogma of an unpalatable kind,)
which has even rendered popular the pretext afforded by
these same mutilated copies for the grave resuscitation of
doubts, never as it would seem seriously entertained by any
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page003">[pg 003]</span><a name="Pg003" id="Pg003" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the ancients; and which, at all events for 1300 years and
upwards, have deservedly sunk into oblivion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whilst I write, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmost divine explication of the
chiefest articles of our Christian belief,‚Äù</span> the Athanasian
Creed,<a id="noteref_2" name="noteref_2" href="#note_2"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">2</span></span></a>
is made the object of incessant assaults.<a id="noteref_3" name="noteref_3" href="#note_3"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">3</span></span></a>
But then it is remembered that statements quite as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúuncharitable‚Äù</span>
as any which this Creed contains are found in the 16th
verse of S. Mark's concluding chapter; are in fact the words
of Him whose very Name is Love. The precious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">warning
clause</span></em>, I say, (miscalled <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúdamnatory,‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_4" name="noteref_4" href="#note_4"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">4</span></span></a>) which an impertinent officiousness is for glossing with a rubric
and weakening with an apology, proceeded from Divine lips,‚Äîat least
if these concluding verses be genuine. How shall this inconvenient
circumstance be more effectually dealt with than
by accepting the suggestion of the most recent editors, that
S. Mark's concluding verses are an unauthorised addition
to his Gospel? <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIf it be acknowledged that the passage
has a harsh sound,‚Äù</span> (remarks Dean Stanley,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúunlike the
usual utterances of Him who came not to condemn but to
save, the discoveries of later times have shewn, almost beyond
doubt, that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not a part of S. Mark's Gospel, but
an addition by another hand</span></em>; of which the weakness in the
external evidence coincides with the internal evidence in
proving its later origin.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_5" name="noteref_5" href="#note_5"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">5</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Modern prejudice, then,‚Äîadded to a singularly exaggerated
estimate of the critical importance of the testimony
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of our two oldest Codices, (another of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúdiscoveries of
later times,‚Äù</span> concerning which I shall have more to say
by-and-by,)‚Äîmust explain why the opinion is even popular
that the last twelve verses of S. Mark are a spurious appendix
to his Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not that Biblical Critics would have us believe that the
Evangelist left off at verse 8, intending that the words,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúneither
said they anything to any man, for they were
afraid,‚Äù</span> should be the conclusion of his Gospel. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNo one
can imagine,‚Äù</span> (writes Griesbach,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat Mark cut short the
thread of his narrative at that
place.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_6" name="noteref_6" href="#note_6"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">6</span></span></a>
It is on all hands eagerly admitted, that so abrupt a termination must be held
to mark an incomplete or else an uncompleted work. How,
then, in the original autograph of the Evangelist, is it supposed
that the narrative proceeded? This is what no one
has even ventured so much as to conjecture. It is assumed,
however, that the original termination of the Gospel, whatever
it may have been, has perished. We appeal, of course,
to its actual termination: and,‚ÄîOf what nature then, (we
ask,) is the supposed necessity for regarding the last twelve
verses of S. Mark's Gospel as a spurious substitute for what
the Evangelist originally wrote? What, in other words,
has been the history of these modern doubts; and by what
steps have they established themselves in books, and won
the public ear?

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is only since the appearance of Griesbach's second edition
[1796-1806] that Critics of the New Testament have
permitted themselves to handle the last twelve verses of
S. Mark's Gospel with disrespect. Previous critical editions
of the New Testament are free from this reproach. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere
is no reason for doubting the genuineness of this portion of
Scripture,‚Äù</span> wrote Mill in 1707, after a review of the evidence
(as far as he was acquainted with it) for and against.
Twenty-seven years later, appeared Bengel's edition of the
New Testament (1734); and Wetstein, at the end of another
seventeen years (1751-2), followed in the same field. Both
editors, after rehearsing the adverse testimony <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in extenso</span></span>,
left the passage in undisputed possession of its place. Alter
in 1786-7, and Birch in 1788,<a id="noteref_7" name="noteref_7" href="#note_7"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">7</span></span></a> (suspicious as the latter evidently
was of its genuineness,) followed their predecessors'
example. But Matthaei, (who also brought his labours to
a close in the year 1788,) was not content to give a silent
suffrage. He had been for upwards of fourteen years a laborious
collator of Greek MSS. of the New Testament, and
was so convinced of the insufficiency of the arguments which
had been brought against these twelve verses of S. Mark,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that with no ordinary warmth, no common acuteness, he
insisted on their genuineness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWith Griesbach,‚Äù</span> (remarks Dr.
Tregelles,)<a id="noteref_8" name="noteref_8" href="#note_8"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">8</span></span></a> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTexts which may be called really critical begin;‚Äù</span> and Griesbach is the
first to insist that the concluding verses of S. Mark are spurious.
That he did not suppose the second Gospel to have always
ended at verse 8, we have seen already.<a id="noteref_9" name="noteref_9" href="#note_9"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">9</span></span></a> He was of opinion,
however, that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúat some very remote period, the original
ending of the Gospel perished,‚Äîdisappeared perhaps <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from
the Evangelist's own copy</span></em>,‚Äîand that the present ending was
by some one substituted in its place.‚Äù</span> Griesbach further invented
the following elaborate and extraordinary hypothesis
to account for the existence of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He invites his readers to believe that when, (before the
end of the second century,) the four Evangelical narratives
were collected into a volume and dignified with the title of
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe Gospel,‚Äù</span>‚ÄîS. Mark's narrative was furnished by some
unknown individual with its actual termination in order to
remedy its manifest incompleteness; and that this volume
became the standard of the Alexandrine recension of the
text: in other words, became the fontal source of a mighty
family of MSS. by Griesbach designated as <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAlexandrine.‚Äù</span>
But there will have been here and there in existence isolated
copies of one or more of the Gospels; and in all of these,
S. Mark's Gospel, (by the hypothesis,) will have ended
abruptly at the eighth verse. These copies of single Gospels,
when collected together, are presumed by Griesbach
to have constituted <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Western recension.‚Äù</span> If, in codices
of this family also, the self-same termination is now all but
universally found, the fact is to be accounted for, (Griesbach
says,) by the natural desire which possessors of the
Gospels will have experienced to supplement their imperfect
copies as best they might. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet this conjecture be accepted,‚Äù</span>
proceeds the learned veteran,‚Äî(unconscious apparently
that he has been demanding acceptance for at least
half-a-dozen wholly unsupported as well as entirely gratuitous
conjectures,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúand every difficulty disappears; and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
it becomes perfectly intelligible how there has crept into
almost every codex which has been written, from the second
century downwards, a section quite different from the original
and genuine ending of S. Mark, which disappeared
before the four Gospels were collected into a single volume.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîIn
other words, if men will but be so accommodating as
to assume that the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel disappeared
before any one had the opportunity of transcribing
the Evangelist's inspired autograph, they will have no
difficulty in understanding that the present conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel was not really written by S. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It should perhaps be stated in passing, that Griesbach
was driven into this curious maze of unsupported conjecture
by the exigencies of his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúRecension Theory;‚Äù</span> which, inasmuch
as it has been long since exploded, need not now occupy
us. But it is worth observing that the argument already
exhibited, (such as it is,) breaks down under the weight of
the very first fact which its learned author is obliged to lay
upon it. Codex B.,‚Äîthe solitary manuscript witness for
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitting</span></em> the clause in question, (for Codex ◊ê had not yet
been discovered,)‚Äîhad been already claimed by Griesbach
as a chief exponent of his so-called <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAlexandrine Recension.‚Äù</span>
But then, on the Critic's own hypothesis, (as we have seen
already,) Codex B. ought, on the contrary, to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contained</span></em>
it. How was that inconvenient fact to be got over?
Griesbach quietly remarks in a foot-note that Codex B.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has affinity</span></em> with the Eastern family of MSS.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîThe misfortune
of being saddled with a worthless theory was surely
never more apparent. By the time we have reached this
point in the investigation, we are reminded of nothing so
much as of the weary traveller who, having patiently pursued
an <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ignis fatuus</span></span> through half the night, beholds it at
last vanish; but not until it has conducted him up to his
chin in the mire.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Neither Hug, nor Scholz his pupil,‚Äîwho in 1808 and
1830 respectively followed Griesbach with modifications of
his recension-theory,‚Äîconcurred in the unfavourable sentence
which their illustrious predecessor had passed on the
concluding portion of S. Mark's Gospel. The latter even
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
eagerly vindicated its genuineness.<a id="noteref_10" name="noteref_10" href="#note_10"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">10</span></span></a>
But with Lachmann,‚Äîwhose unsatisfactory text of the Gospels appeared in
1842,‚Äîoriginated a new principle of Textual Revision;
the principle, namely, of paying exclusive and absolute
deference to the testimony of a few arbitrarily selected
ancient documents; no regard being paid to others of
the same or of yet higher antiquity. This is not the
right place for discussing this plausible and certainly most
convenient scheme of textual revision. That it leads to
conclusions little short of irrational, is certain. I notice it
only because it supplies the clue to the result which, as far
as S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is concerned, has been since arrived
at by Dr. Tischendorf, Dr. Tregelles, and Dean Alford,<a id="noteref_11" name="noteref_11" href="#note_11"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">11</span></span></a>‚Äîthe
three latest critics who have formally undertaken to
reconstruct the sacred Text.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
They agree in assuring their readers that the genuine
Gospel of S. Mark extends no further than ch. xvi. ver. 8:
in other words, that all that follows the words ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ
is an unauthorized addition by some later hand; <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa
fragment,‚Äù</span>‚Äîdistinguishable from the rest of the Gospel not
less by internal evidence than by external testimony. This
verdict becomes the more important because it proceeds from
men of undoubted earnestness and high ability; who cannot
be suspected of being either unacquainted with the evidence
on which the point in dispute rests, nor inexperienced in
the art of weighing such evidence. Moreover, their verdict
has been independently reached; is unanimous; is unhesitating;
has been eagerly proclaimed by all three on many
different occasions as well as in many different places;<a id="noteref_12" name="noteref_12" href="#note_12"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">12</span></span></a> and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
may be said to be at present in all but undisputed possession
of the field.<a id="noteref_13" name="noteref_13" href="#note_13"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">13</span></span></a> The first-named Editor enjoys a vast reputation,
and has been generously styled by Mr. Scrivener, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
first Biblical Critic in Europe.‚Äù</span> The other two have produced
text-books which are deservedly held in high esteem,
and are in the hands of every student. The views of such
men will undoubtedly colour the convictions of the next
generation of English Churchmen. It becomes absolutely
necessary, therefore, to examine with the utmost care the
grounds of their verdict, the direct result of which is to
present us with a mutilated Gospel. If they are right,
there is no help for it but that the convictions of eighteen
centuries in this respect must be surrendered. But if Tischendorf
and Tregelles are wrong in this particular, it follows
of necessity that doubt is thrown over the whole of
their critical method. The case is a crucial one. Every
page of theirs incurs suspicion, if their deliberate verdict
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> instance shall prove to be mistaken.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Tischendorf disposes of the whole question in a single
sentence. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThat these verses were not written by Mark,‚Äù</span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(he says,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúadmits of satisfactory proof.‚Äù</span> He then recites
in detail the adverse external testimony which his predecessors
had accumulated; remarking, that it is abundantly
confirmed by internal evidence. Of this he supplies a solitary
sample; but declares that the whole passage is <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúabhorrent‚Äù</span>
to S. Mark's manner. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe facts of the case being
such,‚Äù</span> (and with this he dismisses the subject,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa healthy
piety reclaims against the endeavours of those who are for
palming off as Mark's what the Evangelist is so plainly
shewn to have known nothing at all about.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_14" name="noteref_14" href="#note_14"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">14</span></span></a>
A mass of laborious annotation which comes surging in at the close
of verse 8, and fills two of Tischendorf's pages, has the effect
of entirely divorcing the twelve verses in question from the
inspired text of the Evangelist. On the other hand, the evidence
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in favour</span></em> of the place is despatched in less than twelve
lines. What can be the reason that an Editor of the New
Testament parades elaborately every particular of the evidence,
(such as it is,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em> the genuineness of a considerable
portion of the Gospel; and yet makes summary work
with the evidence in its favour? That Tischendorf has at
least entirely made up his mind on the matter in hand is
plain. Elsewhere, he speaks of the Author of these verses
as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pseudo Marcus</span></span>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_15" name="noteref_15" href="#note_15"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">15</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Dr. Tregelles has expressed himself most fully on this
subject in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAccount of the Printed Text of the Greek
New Testament‚Äù</span> (1854). The respected author undertakes
to shew <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the early testimony that S. Mark did not
write these verses is confirmed by existing monuments.‚Äù</span>
Accordingly, he announces as the result of the propositions
which he thinks he has established, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">book of Mark
himself</span></em> extends no further than ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ.‚Äù</span> He is the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
only critic I have met with to whom it does not seem incredible
that S. Mark did actually conclude his Gospel in
this abrupt way: observing that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúperhaps we do not know
enough of the circumstances of S. Mark when he wrote his
Gospel to say whether he did or did not leave it with a complete
termination.‚Äù</span> In this modest suggestion at least Dr.
Tregelles is unassailable, since we know absolutely nothing
whatever about <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe circumstances of S. Mark,‚Äù</span> (or of any
other Evangelist,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhen he wrote his Gospel:‚Äù</span> neither
indeed are we quite sure <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>. But when he
goes on to declare, notwithstanding, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the remaining
twelve verses, by whomsoever written, have a full claim
to be received as an authentic part of the second Gospel;‚Äù</span>
and complains that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthere is in some minds a kind of
timidity with regard to Holy Scripture, as if all our notions
of its authority depended on our knowing who was the
writer of each particular portion; instead of simply seeing
and owning that it was given forth from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>, and that it
is as much His as were the Commandments of the Law
written by His own finger on the tables of stone;‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_16" name="noteref_16" href="#note_16"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">16</span></span></a>‚Äîthe learned writer betrays a misapprehension of the question
at issue, which we are least of all prepared to encounter in
such a quarter. We admire his piety but it is at the expense
of his critical sagacity. For the question is not at all
one of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authorship</span></em>, but only one of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuineness</span></em>. Have the
codices been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mutilated</span></em> which do <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> contain these verses?
If they have, then must these verses be held to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuine</span></em>.
But on the contrary, Have the codices been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supplemented</span></em>
which contain them? Then are these verses certainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spurious</span></em>.
There is no help for it but they must either be held
to be an integral part of the Gospel, and therefore, in default
of any proof to the contrary, as certainly by S. Mark as any
other twelve verses which can be named; or else an unauthorized
addition to it. If they belong to the post-apostolic
age it is idle to insist on their Inspiration, and to
claim that this <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúauthentic anonymous addition to what
Mark himself wrote down‚Äù</span> is as much the work of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>

passes comprehension.‚Äù</span> It passes even Dr. Davidson's
comprehension; (for the foregoing words are his;) and

at trifles.<a id="noteref_17" name="noteref_17" href="#note_17"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">17</span></span></a>

3. Dean Alford went a little further than any of his predecessors.
He says that this passage <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwas placed as a completion
of the Gospel soon after the Apostolic period,‚Äîthe
Gospel itself having been, for some reason unknown to us,
left incomplete. The most probable supposition‚Äù</span> (he adds)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last leaf of the original Gospel was torn away</span></em>.‚Äù</span>
The italics in this conjecture (which was originally Griesbach's)
are not mine. The internal evidence (declares the
same learned writer) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúpreponderates vastly against the authorship
of Mark;‚Äù</span> or (as he elsewhere expresses it) against
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúits genuineness as a work of the Evangelist.‚Äù</span> Accordingly,
in his Prolegomena, (p. 38) he describes it as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
remarkable fragment</span></em> at the end of the Gospel.‚Äù</span> After this,
we are the less astonished to find that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">closes the second
Gospel at ver.</span></em> 8; introduces the Subscription there; and encloses
the twelve verses which follow within heavy brackets.
Thus, whereas from the days of our illustrious countryman
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page013">[pg 013]</span><a name="Pg013" id="Pg013" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Mill (1707), the editors of the N. T. have either been silent
on the subject, or else have whispered only that this section
of the Gospel is to be received with less of confidence than
the rest,‚Äîit has been reserved for the present century to
convert the ancient suspicions into actual charges. The
latest to enter the field have been the first to execute Griesbach's
adverse sentence pronounced fifty years ago, and to
load the blessed Evangelist with bonds.

Ascension. (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHast thou killed, and also taken possession?‚Äù</span>)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Such, then, is the hostile verdict concerning these last
twelve verses which I venture to dispute, and which I trust
I shall live to see reversed. The writers above cited will be
found to rely (1.) on the external evidence of certain ancient
MSS.; and (2.) on Scholia which state <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the more
ancient and accurate copies terminated the Gospel at ver. 8.‚Äù</span>
(3.) They assure us that this is confirmed by a formidable
array of Patristic authorities. (4.) Internal proof is declared
not to be wanting. Certain incoherences and inaccuracies
are pointed out. In fine, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe phraseology and style of
the section‚Äù</span> are declared to be <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúunfavourable to its authenticity;‚Äù</span>
not a few of the words and expressions being
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúforeign to the diction of Mark.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîI propose to shew that
all these confident and imposing statements are to a great
extent either mistakes or exaggerations, and that the slender
residuum of fact is about as powerless to achieve the purpose
of the critics as were the seven green withs of the Philistines
to bind Samson.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In order to exhibit successfully what I have to offer on
this subject, I find it necessary to begin (in the next chapter)
at the very beginning. I think it right, however, in this
place to premise a few plain considerations which will be of
use to us throughout all our subsequent inquiry; and which
indeed we shall never be able to afford to lose sight of
for long.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The question at issue being simply this,‚ÄîWhether it is
reasonable to suspect that the last twelve verses of S. Mark
are a spurious accretion and unauthorized supplement to his
Gospel, or not?‚Äîthe whole of our business clearly resolves
itself into an examination of what has been urged in proof
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page015">[pg 015]</span><a name="Pg015" id="Pg015" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the former alternative is the correct one. Our opponents
maintain that these verses did not form part of the
original autograph of the Evangelist. But it is a known
rule in the Law of Evidence that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the burthen of proof lies on
the party who asserts the affirmative of the issue</span></em>.<a id="noteref_23" name="noteref_23" href="#note_23"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">23</span></span></a> We have
therefore to ascertain in the present instance what the supposed
proof is exactly worth; remembering always that in
this subject-matter a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">high degree of probability</span></em> is the only
kind of proof which is attainable. When, for example, it is
contended that the famous words in S. John's first Epistle
(1 S. John v. 7, 8,) are not to be regarded as genuine, the
fact that they are away from almost every known Codex
is accepted as a proof that they were also away from the
autograph of the Evangelist. On far less weighty evidence,
in fact, we are at all times prepared to yield the hearty
assent of our understanding in this department of sacred
science.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, it will be found that evidence of overwhelming
weight, if not of an entirely different kind, is required in
the present instance: as I proceed to explain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. When it is contended that our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s reply to the
young ruler (S. Matt. xix. 17) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was not</span></em> Œ§·Ω∑ ŒºŒµ Œª·Ω≥Œ≥ŒµŒπœÇ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏·ΩπŒΩ;
Œø·ΩêŒ¥Œµ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏·Ω∏œÇ, Œµ·º∞ Œº·Ω¥ Œµ·øñœÇ, ·ΩÅ ŒòŒµ·ΩπœÇ,‚Äîit is at the same time insisted
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it was</span></em> Œ§·Ω∑ ŒºŒµ ·ºêœÅœâœÑ·æ∑œÇ œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑŒø·ø¶ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏Œø·ø¶; Œµ·øñœÇ ·ºêœÉœÑ·Ω∂ŒΩ
·ΩÅ ·ºÄŒ≥Œ±Œ∏·ΩπœÇ. It is proposed to omit the former words <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> because
an alternative clause is at hand, which it is proposed
to substitute in its room.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Again. When it is claimed that some given passage
of the Textus Receptus,‚ÄîS. Mark ch xv. 28, for example,
(Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêœÄŒªŒ∑œÅ·ΩΩŒ∏Œ∑ ·º° Œ≥œÅŒ±œÜ·Ω¥ ·º° Œª·Ω≥Œ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒ±, ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ ·ºÄŒΩ·ΩπŒºœâŒΩ ·ºêŒªŒøŒ≥·Ω∑œÉŒ∏Œ∑,)
or the Doxology in S. Matth. vi. 13,‚Äîis spurious,
all that is pretended is that certain words are an unauthorized
addition to the inspired text; and that by simply
omitting them we are so far restoring the Gospel to its
original integrity.‚ÄîThe same is to be said concerning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
other charge of interpolation which can be named</span></em>. If the
celebrated <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúpericopa de adulter√¢,‚Äù</span> for instance, be indeed
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page016">[pg 016]</span><a name="Pg016" id="Pg016" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not genuine, we have but to leave out those twelve verses
of S. John's Gospel, and to read chap. vii. 52 in close sequence
with chap. viii. 12; and we are assured that we are put in
possession of the text as it came from the hands of its inspired
Author. Nor, (it must be admitted), is any difficulty
whatever occasioned thereby; for there is no reason assignable
why the two last-named verses should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> cohere; (there
is no internal improbability, I mean, in the supposition;)
neither does there exist any <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">√† priori</span></span> reason why a considerable
portion of narrative should be looked for in that particular
part of the Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. But the case is altogether different, as all must see,
when it is proposed to get rid of the twelve verses which
for 1700 years and upwards have formed the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel; no alternative conclusion being proposed
to our acceptance. For let it be only observed what this
proposal practically amounts to and means.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a.</span></span>) And first, it does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> mean that S. Mark
himself, with design, brought his Gospel to a close at the words ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> supposition would in fact be irrational. It does
not mean, I say, that by simply leaving out those last
twelve verses we shall be restoring the second Gospel to its
original integrity. And this it is which makes the present
a different case from every other, and necessitates a fuller,
if not a different kind of proof.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b.</span></span>) What then? It means that although an abrupt and
impossible termination would confessedly be the result of
omitting verses 9-20, no nearer approximation to the original
autograph of the Evangelist is at present attainable.
Whether S. Mark was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interrupted</span></em> before he could finish his
Gospel,‚Äî(as Dr. Tregelles and Professor Norton suggest;)‚Äîin
which case it will have been published by its Author
in an unfinished state: or whether <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last leaf was torn
away</span></em>‚Äù</span> before a single copy of the original could be procured,‚Äî(a
view which is found to have recommended itself
to Griesbach;)‚Äîin which case it will have once had a different
termination from at present; which termination however,
by the hypothesis, has since been irrecoverably lost;‚Äî(and
to one of these two wild hypotheses the critics are
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page017">[pg 017]</span><a name="Pg017" id="Pg017" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
logically reduced;)‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> we are not certainly told. The
critics are only agreed in assuming that S. Mark's Gospel
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was at first without the verses which at present conclude it</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this assumption, (that a work which has been held
to be a complete work for seventeen centuries and upwards
was originally incomplete,) of course requires <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em>. The
foregoing improbable theories, based on a gratuitous assumption,
are confronted <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in limine</span></span> with a formidable obstacle
which must be absolutely got rid of before they can be
thought entitled to a serious hearing. It is a familiar and
a fatal circumstance that the Gospel of S. Mark has been
furnished with its present termination ever since the second
century of the Christian √¶ra.<a id="noteref_24" name="noteref_24" href="#note_24"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">24</span></span></a> In default, therefore, of distinct
historical evidence or definite documentary proof that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at some earlier period than that</span></em> it terminated abruptly, nothing
short of the utter unfitness of the verses which at present
conclude S. Mark's Gospel to be regarded as the work
of the Evangelist, would warrant us in assuming that they
are the spurious accretion of the post-apostolic age: and as
such, at the end of eighteen centuries, to be deliberately
rejected. We must absolutely be furnished, I say, with internal
evidence of the most unequivocal character; or else
with external testimony of a direct and definite kind, if we
are to admit that the actual conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel
is an unauthorized substitute for something quite different
that has been lost. I can only imagine one other thing
which could induce us to entertain such an opinion; and
that would be the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">general</span></em> consent of MSS., Fathers, and
Versions in leaving these verses out. Else, it is evident
that we are logically <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forced</span></em> to adopt the far easier supposition
that (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> S. Mark, but) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some copyist of the third century</span></em>
left a copy of S. Mark's Gospel unfinished; which unfinished
copy became the fontal source of the mutilated copies which
have come down to our own times.<a id="noteref_25" name="noteref_25" href="#note_25"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">25</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page018">[pg 018]</span><a name="Pg018" id="Pg018" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have thought it right to explain the matter thus fully
at the outset; not in order to prejudge the question, (for
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> could answer no good purpose,) but only in order that
the reader may have clearly set before him the real nature
of the issue. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIs it reasonable to suspect that the concluding
verses of S. Mark are a spurious accretion and unauthorized
supplement to his Gospel, or not?‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> is the question
which we have to consider,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> question. And
while I proceed to pass under careful review all the evidence
on this subject with which I am acquainted, I shall be again
and again obliged to direct the attention of my reader to its
bearing on the real point at issue. In other words, we shall
have again and again to ask ourselves, how far it is rendered
probable by each fresh article of evidence that S. Mark's
Gospel, when it left the hands of its inspired Author, was an
unfinished work; the last chapter ending abruptly at ver. 8?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will only point out, before passing on, that the course
which has been adopted towards S. Mark xvi. 9-20, by the
latest Editors of the New Testament, is simply illogical.
Either they regard these verses as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibly</span></em> genuine, or else
as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> spurious. If they entertain (as they say they
do) a decided opinion that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> genuine, they ought
(if they would be consistent) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to banish them from the text</span></em>.<a id="noteref_26" name="noteref_26" href="#note_26"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">26</span></span></a> Conversely, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">since they do not banish them from the
text</span></em>, they have no right to pass a fatal sentence upon them; to designate
their author as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúpseudo-Marcus;‚Äù</span> to handle them in
contemptuous fashion. The plain truth is, these learned men
are better than their theory; the worthlessness of which they
are made to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">feel</span></em> in the present most conspicuous instance.
It reduces them to perplexity. It has landed them in inconsistency
and error.‚ÄîThey will find it necessary in the
end to reverse their convictions. They cannot too speedily
reconsider their verdict, and retrace their steps.

1. It is well known that for determining the Text of the

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Versions</span></span>,‚Äî(3.) on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span>.
And it is even self-evident that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most ancient</span></em> MSS.,‚Äîthe
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">earliest</span></em> Versions,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oldest</span></em> of the Fathers,
will probably be in every instance the most trustworthy
witnesses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Further, it is obvious that a really ancient Codex of
the Gospels must needs supply more valuable critical help
in establishing the precise Text of Scripture than can possibly
be rendered by any Translation, however faithful:
while Patristic citations are on the whole a less decisive
authority, even than Versions. The reasons are chiefly
these:‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a.</span></span>) Fathers often quote Scripture loosely, if not
licentiously; and sometimes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">allude</span></em> only when they seem to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quote</span></em>. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b.</span></span>) They appear to have too often depended
on their memory, and sometimes are demonstrably loose and inaccurate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page020">[pg 020]</span><a name="Pg020" id="Pg020" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in their citations; the same Father being observed
to quote the same place in different ways. (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c.</span></span>) Copyists and
Editors may not be altogether depended upon for the exact
form of such supposed quotations. Thus the evidence of
Fathers must always be to some extent precarious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. On the other hand, it cannot be too plainly pointed
out that when,‚Äîinstead of certifying ourselves of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">actual
words employed</span></em> by an Evangelist, their precise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> and
exact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sequence</span></em>,‚Äîour object is only to ascertain whether
a considerable passage of Scripture is genuine or not; is to
be rejected or retained; was known or was not known in the
earliest ages of the Church; then, instead of supplying the
least important evidence, Fathers become by far the most
valuable witnesses of all. This entire subject may be conveniently
illustrated by an appeal to the problem before us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Of course, if we possessed copies of the Gospels coeval
with their authors, nothing could compete with such evidence.
But then unhappily nothing of the kind is the case.
The facts admit of being stated within the compass of a few
lines. We have one Codex (the Vatican, B) which is thought
to belong to the first half of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century;
and another, the newly discovered Codex Sinaiticus, (at St. Petersburg, ◊ê)
which is certainly not quite so old,‚Äîperhaps by 50 years.
Next come two famous codices; the Alexandrine (in the
British Museum, A) and the Codex Ephraemi (in the Paris
Library, C), which are probably from 50 to 100 years more
recent still. The Codex Bezae (at Cambridge, D) is considered
by competent judges to be the depository of a recension
of the text as ancient as any of the others. Notwithstanding
its strangely depraved condition therefore,‚Äîthe
many <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmonstra potius quam variae lectiones‚Äù</span> which it
contains,‚Äîit may be reckoned with the preceding four,
though it must be 50 or 100 years later than the latest of
them. After this, we drop down, (as far as S. Mark is concerned,)
to 2 uncial MSS. of the viii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,‚Äî7 of
the ix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>,‚Äî4 of the
ix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> or
x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>,<a id="noteref_29" name="noteref_29" href="#note_29"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">29</span></span></a>
while cursives of the xi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
and xii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page021">[pg 021]</span><a name="Pg021" id="Pg021" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
centuries are very numerous indeed,‚Äîthe copies increasing
in number in a rapid ratio as we descend the stream of Time.
Our primitive manuscript witnesses, therefore, are but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em>
in number at the utmost. And of these it has never been
pretended that the oldest is to be referred to an earlier date
than the beginning of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,
while it is thought by competent judges that the last named may very possibly
have been written quite late in the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. Are we then reduced to this fourfold, (or at most fivefold,)
evidence concerning the text of the Gospels,‚Äîon evidence
of not quite certain date, and yet (as we all believe) not
reaching further back than to the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century of our √¶ra? Certainly not. Here, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Fathers</span></span> come to our
aid. There are perhaps as many as an hundred Ecclesiastical Writers older
than the oldest extant Codex of the N. T.: while between
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 300 and <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 600, (within which
limits our five oldest MSS. may be considered certainly to fall,) there exist about
two hundred Fathers more. True, that many of these have
left wondrous little behind them; and that the quotations
from Holy Scripture of the greater part may justly be described
as rare and unsatisfactory. But what then? From
the three hundred, make a liberal reduction; and an hundred
writers will remain who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">frequently</span></em> quote the New
Testament, and who, when they do quote it, are probably
as trustworthy witnesses to the Truth of Scripture as either
Cod. ◊ê or Cod. B. We have indeed heard a great deal too
much of the precariousness of this class of evidence: not
nearly enough of the gross inaccuracies which disfigure the
text of those two Codices. Quite surprising is it to discover
to what an extent Patristic quotations from the New Testament
have evidently retained their exact original form.
What we chiefly desiderate at this time is a more careful
revision of the text of the Fathers, and more skilfully
elaborated indices of the works of each: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> of them
having been hitherto satisfactorily indexed. It would be
easy to demonstrate the importance of bestowing far more
attention on this subject than it seems to have hitherto
enjoyed: but I shall content myself with citing a single
instance; and for this, (in order not to distract the reader's
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page022">[pg 022]</span><a name="Pg022" id="Pg022" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attention), I shall refer him to the Appendix.<a id="noteref_30" name="noteref_30" href="#note_30"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">30</span></span></a> What is at least beyond the limits of controversy, whenever <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
genuineness of a considerable passage of Scripture</span></em> is the point in dispute,
the testimony of Fathers who undoubtedly recognise
that passage, is beyond comparison the most valuable testimony
we can enjoy.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. For let it be only considered what is implied by
a Patristic appeal to the Gospel. It amounts to this:‚Äîthat
a conspicuous personage, probably a Bishop of the
Church,‚Äîone, therefore, whose history, date, place, are all
more or less matter of notoriety,‚Äîgives us his written assurance
that the passage in question was found in that copy of
the Gospels which he was accustomed himself to employ;
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the uncial codex</span></em>, (it has long since perished) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which belonged to
himself</span></em> or to the Church which he served. It is evident, in
short, that any objection to quotations from Scripture in the
writings of the ancient Fathers can only apply to the form
of those quotations; not to their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>. It is just as
certain that a verse of Scripture was actually read by the
Father who unmistakedly refers to it, as if we had read it
with him; even though the gravest doubts may be entertained
as to the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúipsissima verba‚Äù</span> which were found in his
own particular copy. He may have trusted to his memory:
or copyists may have taken liberties with his writings: or
editors may have misrepresented what they found in the
written copies. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">form</span></em> of the quoted verse, I repeat, may
have suffered almost to any extent. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">substance</span></em>, on the
contrary, inasmuch as it lay wholly beyond their province,
may be looked upon as an indisputable <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. Some such preliminary remarks, (never out of place
when quotations from the Fathers are to be considered,)
cannot well be withheld when the most venerable Ecclesiastical
writings are appealed to. The earliest of the Fathers
are observed to quote with singular licence,‚Äîto <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">allude</span></em> rather
than to quote. Strange to relate, those ancient men seem
scarcely to have been aware of the grave responsibility they
incurred when they substituted expressions of their own for
the utterances of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>. It is evidently not so much
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page023">[pg 023]</span><a name="Pg023" id="Pg023" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">memory</span></em> is in fault, as their <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">judgment</span></em>,‚Äîin that
they evidently hold themselves at liberty to paraphrase, to
recast, to reconstruct.<a id="noteref_31" name="noteref_31" href="#note_31"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">31</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. Thus, it is impossible to resist the inference that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Papias</span></span>
refers to S. Mark xvi. 18 when he records a marvellous
tradition concerning <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúJustus surnamed Barsabas,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhow
that after drinking noxious poison, through the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s grace
he experienced no evil consequence.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_32" name="noteref_32" href="#note_32"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">32</span></span></a> He does not give <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the words</span></em> of the Evangelist. It is even
surprising how completely he passes them by; and yet the allusion to the place
just cited is manifest. Now, Papias is a writer who lived so
near the time of the Apostles that he made it his delight
to collect their traditional sayings. His date (according to
Clinton) is <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 100.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Justin Martyr</span></span>, the date of whose first Apology is
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 151, is observed to say concerning the Apostles that,
after our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s Ascension,‚Äî·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩπŒΩœÑŒµœÇ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œáŒø·ø¶

verse of S. Mark's Gospel,‚Äî·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøŒπ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩπŒΩœÑŒµœÇ ·ºêŒ∫·ΩµœÅœÖŒæŒ±ŒΩ œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œáŒø·ø¶.
And thus it is found that the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel was familiarly known within fifty years
of the death of the last of the Evangelists.

III. When <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Iren√¶us</span></span>, in his third Book against Heresies,
deliberately quotes and remarks upon the 19th verse of the
last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel,<a id="noteref_34" name="noteref_34" href="#note_34"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">34</span></span></a>
we are put in possession of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page024">[pg 024]</span><a name="Pg024" id="Pg024" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the certain fact that the entire passage now under consideration
was extant in a copy of the Gospels which was
used by the Bishop of the Church of Lyons sometime about
the year <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 180, and which therefore cannot possibly have
been written much more than a hundred years after the
date of the Evangelist himself: while it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> have been
written by a contemporary of S. Mark, and probably <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em>
written by one who lived immediately after his time.‚ÄîWho
sees not that this single piece of evidence is in itself sufficient
to outweigh the testimony of any codex extant? It is
in fact a mere trifling with words to distinguish between
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúManuscript‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPatristic‚Äù</span> testimony in a case like
this: for (as I have already explained) the passage quoted
from S. Mark's Gospel by Iren√¶us is to all intents and purposes
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a fragment from a dated manuscript</span></em>; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> MS.,
demonstrably older by at least one hundred and fifty years
than the oldest copy of the Gospels which has come down
to our times.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Take another proof that these concluding verses of
S. Mark were in the second century accounted an integral
part of his Gospel. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hippolytus</span></span>, Bishop of Portus near
Borne (190-227), a contemporary of Iren√¶us, quotes the
17th and 18th verses in his fragment Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ ŒßŒ±œÅŒπœÉŒº·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ.<a id="noteref_35" name="noteref_35" href="#note_35"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">35</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page025">[pg 025]</span><a name="Pg025" id="Pg025" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Also in his Homily on the heresy of Noetus,<a id="noteref_36" name="noteref_36" href="#note_36"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">36</span></span></a>
Hippolytus has a plain reference to this section of S. Mark's Gospel.
To an inattentive reader, the passage alluded to might seem
to be only the fragment of a Creed; but this is not the
case. In the Creeds, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> spoken
of as Œ±ŒΩŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩπŒΩœÑŒ±: in the Scriptures, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> as ·ºÄŒΩŒ±ŒªŒ∑Œ∏·Ω≥ŒΩœÑŒ±.<a id="noteref_37" name="noteref_37" href="#note_37"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">37</span></span></a>

needs be to S. Mark xvi. 19.

XIII. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jerome</span></span>, on a point like this, is entitled to more
attention than any other Father of the Church. Living
at a very early period, (for he was born in 331 and died in
420,)‚Äîendowed with extraordinary Biblical learning,‚Äîa
man of excellent judgment,‚Äîand a professed Editor of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page028">[pg 028]</span><a name="Pg028" id="Pg028" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the New Testament, for the execution of which task he
enjoyed extraordinary facilities,‚Äîhis testimony is most
weighty. Not unaware am I that Jerome is commonly
supposed to be a witness on the opposite side: concerning
which mistake I shall have to speak largely in <a href="#Chapter_V" class="tei tei-ref">Chapter V</a>.
But it ought to be enough to point out that we should not
have met with these last twelve verses in the Vulgate, had
Jerome held them to be spurious.<a id="noteref_50" name="noteref_50" href="#note_50"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">50</span></span></a>  He familiarly quotes

he makes the extraordinary statement that in certain of the
copies, (especially the Greek,) was found after ver. 14 <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
reply of the eleven Apostles</span></em>, when our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>

To discuss so weak and worthless a forgery,‚Äîno
trace of which is found in any MS. in existence, and of
which nothing whatever is known except what Jerome here
tells us,‚Äîwould be to waste our time indeed. The fact remains,
however, that Jerome, besides giving these last twelve
verses a place in the Vulgate, quotes S. Mark xvi. 14, as
well as ver. 9, in the course of his writings.

It was declared at the outset that when we are seeking to
establish in detail <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Text</span></em> of the Gospels, the testimony
of Manuscripts is incomparably the most important of all.
To early Versions, the second place was assigned. To Patristic
citations, the third. But it was explained that whenever
(as here) the only question to be decided is whether
a considerable portion of Scripture be genuine or not, then,
Patristic references yield to no class of evidence in importance.
To which statement it must now be added that second
only to the testimony of Fathers on such occasions is to be
reckoned the evidence of the oldest of the Versions. The
reason is obvious, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a.</span></span>) We know for the most part the approximate
date of the principal ancient Versions of the New
Testament:‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b.</span></span>) Each Version is represented by at least one
very ancient Codex:‚Äîand (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c.</span></span>) It may be safely assumed that
Translators were never dependant on a single copy of the
original Greek when they executed their several Translations.
Proceed we now to ascertain what evidence the oldest
of the Versions bear concerning the concluding verses of
S. Mark's Gospel: and first of all for the Syriac.

I. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLiterary history,‚Äù</span> (says Mr. Scrivener,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcan hardly

II. This, however, is not all. Within the last thirty years,
fragments of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> very ancient Syriac translation of the
Gospels, (called from the name of its discoverer <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Curetonian
Syriac</span></span>,‚Äù</span>) have come to light:<a id="noteref_60" name="noteref_60" href="#note_60"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">60</span></span></a> and in this translation

codex is referred by Cureton to the middle of the
v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century. At what earlier date the Translation
may have been executed,‚Äîas well as how much older the original Greek
copy may have been which this translator employed,‚Äîcan
of course only be conjectured. But it is clear that we are
listening to another truly primitive witness to the genuineness
of the text now under consideration;‚Äîa witness (like
the last) vastly more ancient than either the Vatican
Codex B, or the Sinaitic Codex ◊ê; more ancient, therefore,
than any Greek copy of the Gospels in existence. We shall
not be thought rash if we claim it for the iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span>
century.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. Even this, however, does not fully represent the sum
of the testimony which the Syriac language bears on this
subject. Philoxenus, Monophysite Bishop of Mabug (Hierapolis)
in Eastern Syria, caused a revision of the Peshito
Syriac to be executed by his Chorepiscopus Polycarp, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>
508; and by the aid of three<a id="noteref_62" name="noteref_62" href="#note_62"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">62</span></span></a>
approved and accurate Greek manuscripts, this revised version of Polycarp was again
revised by Thomas of Hharkel, in the monastery of Antonia
at Alexandria, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 616. The Hharklensian Revision, (commonly
called the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Philoxenian</span></span>,‚Äù</span>) is therefore an extraordinary
monument of ecclesiastical antiquity indeed: for,
being the Revision of a revised Translation of the New
Testament known to have been executed from MSS. which
must have been at least as old as the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,
it exhibits
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page034">[pg 034]</span><a name="Pg034" id="Pg034" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the result of what may be called a collation of copies
made at a time when only four of our extant uncials were
in existence. Here, then, is a singularly important accumulation
of manuscript evidence on the subject of the verses
which of late years it has become the fashion to treat as
spurious. And yet, neither by Polycarp nor by Thomas
of Hharkel, are the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel
omitted.<a id="noteref_63" name="noteref_63" href="#note_63"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">63</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these, if I do not add the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúJerusalem version,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(as
an independent Syriac translation of the Ecclesiastical Sections,
perhaps of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, is
called,<a id="noteref_64" name="noteref_64" href="#note_64"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">64</span></span></a>)‚Äîit is because our fourfold Syriac evidence is already
abundantly sufficient. In itself, it far outweighs in respect of antiquity anything
that can be shewn on the other side. Turn we next to the
Churches of the West.

IV. That Jerome, at the bidding of Pope Damasus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>
382), was the author of that famous Latin version of the
Scriptures called <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">The Vulgate</span></span>, is known to all. It seems
scarcely possible to overestimate the critical importance of
such a work,‚Äîexecuted at such a time,‚Äîunder such auspices,‚Äîand
by a man of so much learning and sagacity as Jerome.
When it is considered that we are here presented with the
results of a careful examination of the best Greek Manuscripts
to which a competent scholar had access in the
middle of the fourth century,‚Äî(and Jerome assures us that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page035">[pg 035]</span><a name="Pg035" id="Pg035" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
he consulted several,)‚Äîwe learn to survey with diminished
complacency our own slender stores (if indeed any at all
exist) of corresponding antiquity. It is needless to add
that the Vulgate contains the disputed verses: that from
no copy of this Version are they away. Now, in such
a matter as this, Jerome's testimony is very weighty indeed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. The Vulgate, however, was but the revision of a much
older translation, generally known as the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Vetus Itala</span></span>.
This Old Latin, which is of African origin and of almost
Apostolic antiquity, (supposed of the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span>
century,) conspires with the Vulgate in the testimony which it bears to the
genuineness of the end of S. Mark's Gospel:<a id="noteref_65" name="noteref_65" href="#note_65"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">65</span></span></a>‚Äîan emphatic

no doubt whatever was entertained concerning the genuineness
of these last twelve verses.

VI. The next place may well be given to the venerable
version of the Gothic Bishop Ulphilas,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 350. Himself
a Cappadocian, Ulphilas probably derived his copies from
Asia Minor. His version is said to have been exposed to
certain corrupting influences; but the unequivocal evidence
which it bears to the last verses of S. Mark is at least unimpeachable,
and must be regarded as important in the
highest degree.<a id="noteref_66" name="noteref_66" href="#note_66"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">66</span></span></a> The oldest extant copy of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gothic</span></span>

for notice: their testimony being so exceedingly ancient

Egypt, (less properly called the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCoptic‚Äù</span> version), which

happily contains the last verse of the Gospel according

After this mass of evidence, it will be enough to record
concerning the Armenian version, that it yields inconstant
testimony: some of the MSS. ending at ver. 8; others
putting after these words the subscription, (·ºêœÖŒ±Œ≥Œ≥·Ω≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞
ŒúŒ±œÅŒ∫ŒøŒΩ,) and then giving the additional verses with a new
subscription: others going on without any break to the
end. This version may be as old as the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century;
but like the Ethiopic [iv-vii?] and the Georgian [vi?] it
comes to us in codices of comparatively recent date. All
this makes it impossible for us to care much for its testimony.
The two last-named versions, whatever their disadvantages
may be, at least bear constant witness to the
genuineness of the verses in dispute.

1. And thus we are presented with a mass of additional
evidence,‚Äîso various, so weighty, so multitudinous, so
venerable,‚Äîin support of this disputed portion of the Gospel,
that it might well be deemed in itself decisive.

3. We may here, in fact, conveniently review the progress
which has been hitherto made in this investigation. And
in order to bar the door against dispute and cavil, let us
be content to waive the testimony of Papias as precarious,
and that of Justin Martyr as too fragmentary to be decisive.
Let us frankly admit that the citation of Vincentius √†
Thibari at the vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Carthaginian Council is
sufficiently inexact to make it unsafe to build upon it. The <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúActa Pilati‚Äù</span>

how will the evidence stand for the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?

It would naturally follow to shew that manuscript evidence
confirms the evidence of the ancient Fathers and of
the early Versions of Scripture. But it will be more satisfactory
that I should proceed to examine without more

a cloud of ancient Fathers against the last twelve verses of
S. Mark. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe absence of this portion from some, from

That this testimony should have been so often appealed
to as proceeding from Gregory of Nyssa,<a id="noteref_70" name="noteref_70" href="#note_70"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">70</span></span></a> is little to the
credit of modern scholarship. One would have supposed
that the gravity of the subject,‚Äîthe importance of the issue,‚Äîthe
sacredness of Scripture, down to its minutest jot and
tittle,‚Äîwould have ensured extraordinary caution, and induced
every fresh assailant of so considerable a portion of
the Gospel to be very sure of his ground before reiterating
what his predecessors had delivered. And yet it is evident
that not one of the recent writers on the subject can have
investigated this matter for himself. It is only due to their
known ability to presume that had they taken ever so little
pains with the foregoing quotation, they would have found
out their mistake.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) For, in the first place, the second <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHomily on the
Resurrection‚Äù</span> printed in the iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> volume of
the works of Gregory of Nyssa, (and which supplies the critics with
their quotation,) is, as every one may see who will take the
trouble to compare them, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word for word the same Homily</span></em>
which Combefis in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNovum Auctarium,‚Äù</span> and Gallandius
in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBibliotheca Patrum‚Äù</span> printed as the work of Hesychius,
and vindicated to that Father, respectively in 1648
and 1776.<a id="noteref_71" name="noteref_71" href="#note_71"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">71</span></span></a>
Now, if a critic chooses to risk his own reputation
by maintaining that the Homily in question is indeed
by Gregory of Nyssa, and is not by Hesychius,‚Äîwell and
good. But since the Homily can have had but one author,
it is surely high time that one of these two claimants should
be altogether dropped from this discussion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Again. Inasmuch as page after page of the same
Homily is observed to reappear, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word for word</span></em>, under the
name of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus of Antioch,‚Äù</span> and to be unsuspiciously
printed as his by Montfaucon in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBibliotheca Coisliniana‚Äù</span>
(1715), and by Cramer in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCatena‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_72" name="noteref_72" href="#note_72"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">72</span></span></a>
(1844),‚Äîalthough
it may very reasonably become a question among
critics whether Hesychius of Jerusalem or Severus of Antioch
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page041">[pg 041]</span><a name="Pg041" id="Pg041" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was the actual author of the Homily in question,<a id="noteref_73" name="noteref_73" href="#note_73"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">73</span></span></a> yet
it is plain that critics must make their election between the
two names; and not bring them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> forward. No one,
I say, has any right to go on quoting <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHesychius,‚Äù</span>‚Äîas Tischendorf and Dr. Davidson are observed to
do:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGregory of Nyssa‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus of Antioch,‚Äù</span>‚Äîas
Dr. Tregelles is found to prefer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) In short, here are three claimants for the authorship
of one and the same Homily. To whichever of the three
we assign it,‚Äî(and competent judges have declared that
there are sufficient reasons for giving it to Hesychius rather
than to Severus,‚Äîwhile <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no one</span></em> is found to suppose that
Gregory of Nyssa was its author,)‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> will not admit that
no further mention must be made of the other two?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) Let it be clearly understood, therefore, that henceforth
the name of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGregory of Nyssa‚Äù</span> must be banished from
this discussion. So must the name of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus of Antioch.‚Äù</span>
The memorable passage which begins,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn the more accurate

II. With respect to whom the case is altogether different.
What that learned Father has delivered concerning
the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel requires to be examined
with attention, and must be set forth much more in detail.
And yet, I will so far anticipate what is about to be offered,
as to say at once that if any one supposes that Eusebius has
anywhere plainly <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äústated that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wanted in many

attention is invited to a plain tale.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was not until 1825 that the world was presented by

It is much to be regretted that we are still as little as
ever in possession of the lost work of Eusebius. It appears
to have consisted of three Books or Parts; the former two
(addressed <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto Stephanus‚Äù</span>) being discussions of difficulties
at the beginning of the Gospel,‚Äîthe last (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto Marinus‚Äù</span>)

forth a difficulty in the form of a Question; and straightway,
to propose a Solution of it,‚Äîwhich commonly assumes
the form of a considerable dissertation. But whether we are
at present in possession of so much as a single entire specimen
of these <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúInquiries and Resolutions‚Äù</span> exactly as it came
from the pen of Eusebius, may reasonably be doubted. That
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page043">[pg 043]</span><a name="Pg043" id="Pg043" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the work which Mai has brought to light is but a highly
condensed exhibition of the original, (and scarcely that,) its
very title shews; for it is headed,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAn abridged selection

Only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> of the original Questions,

been subjected to so severe a process of condensation and
abridgment, that in some instances <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">amputation</span></em> would probably
be a more fitting description of what has taken place.
Accordingly, what were originally two Books or Parts, are
at present represented by XVI. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúInquiries,‚Äù</span> &amp;c, addressed

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page044">[pg 044]</span><a name="Pg044" id="Pg044" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that all this should be clearly apprehended by any one
who desires to know exactly what the alleged evidence of
Eusebius concerning the last chapter of S. Mark's Gospel is
worth,‚Äîas I will explain more fully by-and-by. Let it,
however, be candidly admitted that there seems to be no
reason for supposing that whenever the lost work of Eusebius
comes to light, (and it has been seen within about
300 years<a id="noteref_83" name="noteref_83" href="#note_83"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">83</span></span></a>,) it will exhibit anything essentially different
from what is contained in the famous passage which has
given rise to so much debate, and which may be exhibited
in English as follows. It is put in the form of a reply to
one <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarinus,‚Äù</span> who is represented as asking, first, the following
question:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHow is it, that, according to Matthew [xxviii. 1], the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> appears to have risen <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath;‚Äô</span>

not met with in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the copies of Mark's Gospel: the accurate copies,
at all events, making the end of Mark's narrative come after
the words of the young man who appeared to the women
and said, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòFear not ye! Ye seek <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> of Nazareth,‚Äô</span> &amp;c.:
to which the Evangelist adds,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòAnd when they heard it,
they fled, and said nothing to any man, for they were
afraid.‚Äô</span> For at those words, in almost all copies of the
Gospel according to Mark, comes the end. What follows,
(which is met with seldom, [and only] in some copies, certainly
not in all,) might be dispensed with; especially if it
should prove to contradict the record of the other Evangelists.
This, then, is what a person will say who is for
evading and entirely getting rid of a gratuitous problem.</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBut another, on no account daring to reject anything
whatever which is, under whatever circumstances, met with

it is not opposed to what Matthew says of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>'s
having risen <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath.‚Äô</span> For Mark's expression,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page046">[pg 046]</span><a name="Pg046" id="Pg046" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when He was risen early the first day of the

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when He was risen,‚Äô</span>‚Äîthe sense of the words which
follow being kept separate. Thereby, we shall refer [Mark's]
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòwhen He was risen‚Äô</span> to Matthew's <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath,‚Äô</span>
(for it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> that He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rose</span></em>); and all that comes
after, expressive as it is of a distinct notion, we shall connect
with what follows; (for it was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">early</span></em>, the first day of the
week,‚Äô</span> that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòHe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appeared to Mary Magdalene</span></em>.‚Äô</span>) This is in
fact what John also declares; for he too has recorded that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly,‚Äô</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòthe first day of the week,‚Äô</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>]
appeared to the Magdalene. Thus then Mark also says that He appeared
to her early: not that He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rose</span></em> early, but long before,
(according to that of Matthew, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath:‚Äô</span>
for though He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rose</span></em> then, He did not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appear to Mary</span></em> then,
but <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly.‚Äô</span>) In a word, two distinct seasons are set before
us by these words: first, the season of the Resurrection,‚Äîwhich
was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath;‚Äô</span> secondly, the season of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>'s Appearing,‚Äîwhich was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly.‚Äô</span> The

Mark writes of when he says, (it requires to be read
with a pause,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow, when He was risen,‚Äô</span> Then, after
a comma, what follows is to be spoken,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòEarly, the first

Little did the learned writer anticipate what bitter
fruit his words were destined to bear!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. Let it be freely admitted that what precedes is calculated
at first sight to occasion nothing but surprise and
perplexity. For, in the first place, there really is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no problem
to solve</span></em>. The discrepancy suggested by <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarinus‚Äù</span> at the
outset, is plainly imaginary, the result (chiefly) of a strange
misconception of the meaning of the Evangelist's Greek,‚Äîas
in fact no one was ever better aware than Eusebius
himself. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThese places of the Gospels would never have
occasioned any difficulty,‚Äù</span> he writes in the very next page,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page047">[pg 047]</span><a name="Pg047" id="Pg047" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(but it is the commencement of his reply to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> question
of Marinus,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúif people would but abstain from assuming
that Matthew's phrase (·ΩÄœà·Ω≤ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ) refers to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the evening of the Sabbath-day</span></em>: whereas, (in conformity with
the established idiom of the language,) it obviously refers
to an advanced period of the ensuing night.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_88" name="noteref_88" href="#note_88"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">88</span></span></a>  He proceeds:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe
self-same moment therefore, or very nearly
the self-same, is intended by the Evangelists, only under
different names: and there is no discrepancy whatever between
Matthew's,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath, as it began
to dawn toward the first day of the week,‚Äô</span> and John's‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòThe
first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalen early,
when it was yet dark.‚Äô</span> The Evangelists indicate by different
expressions one and the same moment of time, but
in a broad and general way.‚Äù</span> And yet, if Eusebius knew
all this so well, why did he not say so at once, and close the
discussion? I really cannot tell; except on one hypothesis,‚Äîwhich,
although at first it may sound somewhat extraordinary,
the more I think of the matter, recommends itself to my
acceptance the more. I suspect, then, that the discussion
we have just been listening to, is, essentially, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not an original
production</span></em>: but that Eusebius, having met with the suggestion
in some older writer, (in Origen probably,) reproduced
it in language of his own,‚Äîdoubtless because he thought
it ingenious and interesting, but not by any means because
he regarded it as true. Except on some such theory, I am
utterly unable to understand how Eusebius can have written
so inconsistently. His admirable remarks just quoted, are
obviously a full and sufficient answer,‚Äîthe proper answer
in fact,‚Äîto the proposed difficulty: and it is a memorable
circumstance that the ancients generally were so sensible
of this, that they are found to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em><a id="noteref_89" name="noteref_89" href="#note_89"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">89</span></span></a> substituted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page048">[pg 048]</span><a name="Pg048" id="Pg048" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what Eusebius wrote in reply to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> question of
Marinus for what he wrote in reply to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em>; in other
words, for the dissertation which is occasioning us all this
difficulty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But next, even had the discrepancy been real, the
remedy for it which is here proposed, and which is advocated
with such tedious emphasis, would probably prove
satisfactory to no one. In fact, the entire method advocated
in the foregoing passage is hopelessly vicious. The writer
begins by advancing statements which, if he believed them
to be true, he must have known are absolutely fatal to the
verses in question. This done, he sets about discussing the
possibility of reconciling an isolated expression in S. Mark's
Gospel with another in S. Matthew's: just as if on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
depended the genuineness or spuriousness of the entire context:
as if, in short, the major premiss in the discussion
were some such postulate as the following:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWhatever
in one Gospel cannot be proved to be entirely consistent
with something in another Gospel, is not to be regarded
as genuine.‚Äù</span> Did then the learned Archbishop of C√¶sarea
really suppose that a comma judiciously thrown into the
empty scale might at any time suffice to restore the equilibrium,
and even counterbalance the adverse testimony of
almost every MS. of the Gospels extant? Why does he not
at least deny the truth of the alleged facts to which he
began by giving currency, if not approval; and which, so
long as they are allowed to stand uncontradicted, render all
further argumentation on the subject simply nugatory? As
before, I really cannot tell,‚Äîexcept on the hypothesis which
has been already hazarded.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Note also, (for this is not the least extraordinary feature
of the case,) what vague and random statements those
are which we have been listening to. The entire section
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page049">[pg 049]</span><a name="Pg049" id="Pg049" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(S. Mark xvi. 9-20,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not met with in all</span></em> the copies:‚Äù</span> at
all events <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the accurate</span></em>‚Äù</span> ones. Nay, it is
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">met with seldom</span></em>.‚Äù</span> In fact, it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">absent from</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost all</span></em>‚Äù</span> copies. But,‚ÄîWhich
of these four statements is to stand? The first is
comparatively unimportant. Not so the second. The last
two, on the contrary, would be absolutely fatal,‚Äîif trustworthy?
But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are</span></em> they trustworthy?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To this question only one answer can be returned. The
exaggeration is so gross that it refutes itself. Had it been
merely asserted that the verses in question were wanting in
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></em> of the copies,‚Äîeven had it been insisted that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the best
copies</span></em> were without them,‚Äîwell and good: but to assert that,
in the beginning of the fourth century, from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost all</span></em>‚Äù</span>
copies of the Gospels they were away,‚Äîis palpably untrue.
What had become then of the MSS. from which the Syriac,
the Latin, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the ancient Versions were made? How is the
contradictory evidence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every copy of the Gospels in existence
but two</span></em> to be accounted for? With Iren√¶us and Hippolytus,
with the old Latin and the Vulgate, with the Syriac,
and the Gothic, and the Egyptian versions to refer to, we
are able to assert that the author of such a statement was
guilty of monstrous exaggeration. We are reminded of the
loose and random way in which the Fathers,‚Äî(giants in
Interpretation, but very children in the Science of Textual
Criticism,)‚Äîare sometimes observed to speak about the state
of the Text in their days. We are reminded, for instance,
of the confident assertion of an ancient Critic that the true
reading in S. Luke xxiv. 13 is not <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthree-score‚Äù</span> but <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
hundred</span></em> and three-score;‚Äù</span> for that so <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe accurate copies‚Äù</span>
used to read the place, besides Origen and Eusebius. And
yet (as I have elsewhere explained) the reading ·ºëŒ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂
·ºëŒæ·ΩµŒ∫ŒøŒΩœÑŒ± is altogether impossible. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúApud nos mixta sunt
omnia,‚Äù</span> is Jerome's way of adverting to an evil which,
serious as it was, was yet not nearly so great as he represents;
viz. the unauthorized introduction into one Gospel
of what belongs of right to another. And so in a multitude
of other instances. The Fathers are, in fact, constantly observed
to make critical remarks about the ancient copies
which simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be correct.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page050">[pg 050]</span><a name="Pg050" id="Pg050" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet the author of the exaggeration under review, be it
observed, is clearly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not Eusebius</span></em>. It is evident that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> has
nothing to say against the genuineness of the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel. Those random statements about the copies
with which he began, do not even purport to express his
own sentiments. Nay, Eusebius in a manner repudiates
them; for he introduces them with a phrase which separates
them from himself: and, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis then is what a person will
say,‚Äù</span>‚Äîis the remark with which he finally dismisses them.
It would, in fact, be to make this learned Father stultify
himself to suppose that he proceeds gravely to discuss a
portion of Scripture which he had already deliberately rejected
as spurious. But, indeed, the evidence before us
effectually precludes any such supposition. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHere are two
readings,‚Äù</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú(as is so often the case elsewhere:)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> of which are to be received,‚Äîinasmuch as by the faithful
and pious, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> reading is not held to be genuine rather
than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>; nor <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>.‚Äù</span> And
thus we seem to be presented with the actual opinion of Eusebius, as far as it
can be ascertained from the present passage,‚Äîif indeed he
is to be thought here to offer any personal opinion on the
subject at all; which, for my own part, I entirely doubt.
But whether we are at liberty to infer the actual sentiments
of this Father from anything here delivered or not, quite
certain at least is it that to print only the first half of the
passage, (as Tischendorf and Tregelles have done,) and then
to give the reader to understand that he is reading the
adverse testimony of Eusebius as to the genuineness of the
end of S. Mark's Gospel, is nothing else but to misrepresent
the facts of the case; and, however unintentionally, to deceive
those who are unable to verify the quotation for
themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been urged indeed that Eusebius cannot have recognised
the verses in question as genuine, because a scholium
purporting to be his has been cited by Matthaei from
a Catena at Moscow, in which he appears to assert that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaccording to Mark,‚Äù</span> our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis not recorded to
have appeared to His Disciples after His Resurrection:‚Äù</span> whereas
in S. Mark xvi. 14 it is plainly recorded that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAfterwards
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page051">[pg 051]</span><a name="Pg051" id="Pg051" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He appeared unto the Eleven as they sat at meat.‚Äù</span> May
I be permitted to declare that I am distrustful of the proposed
inference, and shall continue to feel so, until I know
something more about the scholium in question? Up to the
time when this page is printed I have not succeeded in obtaining
from Moscow the details I wish for: but they must
be already on the way, and I propose to embody the result
in a <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPostscript‚Äù</span> which shall form the last page of the
Appendix to the present volume.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Are we then to suppose that there was no substratum of
truth in the allegations to which Eusebius gives such prominence
in the passage under discussion? By no means.
The mutilated state of S. Mark's Gospel in the Vatican
Codex (B) and especially in the Sinaitic Codex (◊ê) sufficiently
establishes the contrary. Let it be freely conceded,
(but in fact it has been freely conceded already,) that there
must have existed in the time of Eusebius <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">many</span></em> copies of
S. Mark's Gospel which were without the twelve concluding
verses. I do but insist that there is nothing whatever in
that circumstance to lead us to entertain one serious doubt
as to the genuineness of these verses. I am but concerned
to maintain that there is nothing whatever in the evidence
which has hitherto come before us,‚Äîcertainly not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
evidence of Eusebius</span></em>,‚Äîto induce us to believe that they are
a spurious addition to S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. We have next to consider what
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jerome</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
has delivered on this subject. So great a name must needs
command attention in any question of Textual Criticism:
and it is commonly pretended that Jerome pronounces emphatically
against the genuineness of the last twelve verses
of the Gospel according to S. Mark. A little attention to
the actual testimony borne by this Father will, it is thought,
suffice to exhibit it in a wholly unexpected light; and induce
us to form an entirely different estimate of its practical
bearing upon the present discussion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be convenient that I should premise that it is in
one of his many exegetical Epistles that Jerome discusses
this matter. A lady named Hedibia, inhabiting the furthest
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page052">[pg 052]</span><a name="Pg052" id="Pg052" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
extremity of Gaul, and known to Jerome only by the ardour
of her piety, had sent to prove him with hard questions.
He resolves her difficulties from Bethlehem:<a id="noteref_90" name="noteref_90" href="#note_90"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">90</span></span></a>
and I may be allowed to remind the reader of what is found to have
been Jerome's practice on similar occasions,‚Äîwhich, to
judge from his writings, were of constant occurrence. In
fact, Apodemius, who brought Jerome the Twelve problems
from Hedibia, brought him Eleven more from a noble
neighbour of hers, Algasia.<a id="noteref_91" name="noteref_91" href="#note_91"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">91</span></span></a>
Once, when a single messenger had conveyed to him out of the African province
a quantity of similar interrogatories, Jerome sent two Egyptian
monks the following account of how he had proceeded
in respect of the inquiry,‚Äî(it concerned 1 Cor. xv. 51,)‚Äîwhich
they had addressed to him:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBeing pressed for
time, I have presented you with the opinions of all the
Commentators; for the most part, translating their very
words; in order both to get rid of your question, and to
put you in possession of ancient authorities on the subject.‚Äù</span>
This learned Father does not even profess to have been in
the habit of delivering his own opinions, or speaking his
own sentiments on such occasions. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis has been hastily
dictated,‚Äù</span> he says in conclusion,‚Äî(alluding to his constant
practice, which was to dictate, rather than to write,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin
order that I might lay before you what have been the
opinions of learned men on this subject, as well as the arguments
by which they have recommended their opinions.
My own authority, (who am but nothing,) is vastly inferior
to that of our predecessors in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>.‚Äù</span> Then, after
special commendation of the learning of Origen and Eusebius,
and the valuable Scriptural expositions of many more,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMy
plan,‚Äù</span> (he says,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis to read the ancients; to prove
all things, to hold fast that which is good; and to abide

We are not surprised, after this straightforward avowal of what was the method
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page053">[pg 053]</span><a name="Pg053" id="Pg053" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
on such occasions with this learned Father, to discover that,
instead of hearing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Jerome</span></em> addressing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hedibia</span></em>,‚Äî(who had
interrogated him concerning the very problem which is at
present engaging our attention,)‚Äîwe find ourselves only
listening to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius</span></em> over again, addressing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Marinus</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis difficulty admits of a two-fold solution,‚Äù</span> Jerome
begins; as if determined that no doubt shall be entertained
as to the source of his inspiration. Then, (making short
work of the tedious disquisition of Eusebius,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEither we
shall reject the testimony of Mark, which is met with in
scarcely any copies of the Gospel,‚Äîalmost all the Greek
codices being without this passage:‚Äî(especially since it
seems to narrate what contradicts the other Gospels:)‚Äîor
else, we shall reply that both Evangelists state what is true:
Matthew, when he says that our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> rose <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòlate in the
week:‚Äô</span> Mark,‚Äîwhen he says that Mary Magdalene saw Him
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly, the first day of the week.‚Äô</span> For the passage must be
thus pointed,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòWhen He was risen:‚Äô</span> and presently, after
a pause, must be added,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòEarly, the first day of the week,
He appeared to Mary Magdalene.‚Äô</span> He therefore who had
risen late in the week, according to Matthew,‚ÄîHimself,
early the first day of the week, according to Mark, appeared
to Mary Magdalene. And this is what John also means,
shewing that it was early on the next day that He appeared.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîTo
understand how faithfully in what precedes
Jerome treads in the footsteps of Eusebius, it is absolutely
necessary to set the Latin of the one over against the Greek
of the other, and to compare them. In order to facilitate
this operation, I have subjoined both originals at foot of the
page: from which it will be apparent that Jerome is here
not so much adopting the sentiments of Eusebius as simply
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translating his words</span></em>.<a id="noteref_93" name="noteref_93" href="#note_93"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">93</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page054">[pg 054]</span><a name="Pg054" id="Pg054" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This, however, is not by any means the strangest feature of
the case. That Jerome should have availed himself ever so
freely of the materials which he found ready to his hand in
the pages of Eusebius cannot be regarded as at all extraordinary,
after what we have just heard from himself of his
customary method of proceeding. It would of course have
suggested the gravest doubts as to whether we were here
listening to the personal sentiment of this Father, or not;
but that would have been all. What are we to think, however,
of the fact that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Hedibia's question to Jerome</span></em> proves on
inspection to be nothing more than a translation of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very
question which Marinus had long before addressed to Eusebius</span></em>?
We read on, perplexed at the coincidence; and speedily
make the notable discovery that her next question, and her
next, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> translations <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word for word</span></em> of the next two of
Marinus. For the proof of this statement the reader is again
referred to the foot of the page.<a id="noteref_94" name="noteref_94" href="#note_94"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">94</span></span></a>
It is at least decisive:
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page055">[pg 055]</span><a name="Pg055" id="Pg055" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and the fact, which admits of only one explanation, can be
attended by only one practical result. It of course shelves
the whole question as far as the evidence of Jerome is concerned.
Whether Hedibia was an actual personage or not,
let those decide who have considered more attentively than
it has ever fallen in my way to do that curious problem,‚ÄîWhat
was the ancient notion of the allowable in Fiction?
That different ideas have prevailed in different ages of the
world as to where fiction ends and fabrication begins;‚Äîthat
widely discrepant views are entertained on the subject even
in our own age;‚Äîall must be aware. I decline to investigate
the problem on the present occasion. I do but claim
to have established beyond the possibility of doubt or cavil
that what we are here presented with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is not the testimony of
Jerome at all</span></em>. It is evident that this learned Father amused
himself with translating for the benefit of his Latin readers
a part of the (lost) work of Eusebius; (which, by the way,
he is found to have possessed in the same abridged form in
which it has come down to ourselves:)‚Äîand he seems to
have regarded it as allowable to attribute to <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHedibia‚Äù</span> the
problems which he there met with. (He may perhaps have
known that Eusebius before him had attributed them, with
just as little reason, to <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarinus.‚Äù</span>) In that age, for aught
that appears to the contrary, it may have been regarded as
a graceful compliment to address solutions of Scripture difficulties
to persons of distinction, who possibly had never
heard of those difficulties before; and even to represent the
Interrogatories which suggested them as originating with
themselves. I offer this only in the way of suggestion, and
am not concerned to defend it. The only point I am concerned
to establish is that Jerome is here a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translator</span></em>, not
an original author: in other words, that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius</span></em> who
here speaks, and not Jerome. For a critic to pretend that it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page056">[pg 056]</span><a name="Pg056" id="Pg056" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> sense the testimony of Jerome which we are here
presented with; that Jerome is one of those Fathers <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwho,
even though they copied from their predecessors, were yet
competent to transmit the record of a fact,‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_95" name="noteref_95" href="#note_95"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">95</span></span></a>‚Äîis entirely to
misunderstand the case. The man who translates,‚Äînot
adopts, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translates</span></em>,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the problem</span></em> as well as its
solution: who deliberately asserts that it emanated from a Lady inhabiting
the furthest extremity of Gaul, who nevertheless was
demonstrably not its author: who goes on to propose as
hers question after question <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbatim as he found them written
in the pages of Eusebius</span></em>; and then resolves them one by one
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the very language of the same Father</span></em>:‚Äîsuch a writer has
clearly conducted us into a region where his individual responsibility
quite disappears from sight. We must hear no
more about Jerome, therefore, as a witness against the genuineness
of the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the contrary. Proof is at hand that Jerome held these
verses to be genuine. The proper evidence of this is supplied
by the fact that he gave them a place in his revision of the
old Latin version of the Scriptures. If he had been indeed
persuaded of their absence from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost all the Greek codices</span></em>,‚Äù</span>
does any one imagine that he would have suffered them to
stand in the Vulgate? If he had met with them in <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">scarcely
any copies of the Gospel</span></em>‚Äù</span>‚Äîdo men really suppose that he
would yet have retained them? To believe this would, again,
be to forget what was the known practice of this Father;
who, because he found the expression <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwithout a cause‚Äù</span>
(Œµ·º∞Œ∫·Ωµ,‚ÄîS. Matth. v. 22,) only <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin certain of his codices,‚Äù</span> but
not <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin the true ones,‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em> it from the Vulgate. Because,
however, he read <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúrighteousness‚Äù</span> (where we read <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúalms‚Äù</span>)
in S. Matth. vi. 1, he exhibits <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">justitiam</span></span>‚Äù</span> in his revision
of the old Latin version. On the other hand, though he knew
of MSS. (as he expressly relates) which read <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúworks‚Äù</span> for
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúchildren‚Äù</span> (·ºîœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ for œÑ·Ω≥Œ∫ŒΩœâŒΩ) in S. Matth. xi. 19, he does
not admit that (manifestly corrupt) reading,‚Äîwhich, however,
is found both in the Codex Vaticanus and the Codex
Sinaiticus. Let this suffice. I forbear to press the matter
further. It is an additional proof that Jerome accepted the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page057">[pg 057]</span><a name="Pg057" id="Pg057" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel that he actually quotes it,
and on more than one occasion: but to prove this, is to prove more than
is here required.<a id="noteref_96" name="noteref_96" href="#note_96"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">96</span></span></a>
I am concerned only to demolish
the assertion of Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and Alford,
and Davidson, and so many more, concerning the testimony of
Jerome; and I have demolished it. I pass on, claiming to
have shewn that the name of Jerome as an adverse witness
must never again appear in this discussion.

IV. and V. But now, while the remarks of Eusebius are
yet fresh in the memory, the reader is invited to recall for
a moment what the author of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHomily on the Resurrection,‚Äù</span>
contained in the works of Gregory of Nyssa (above,
p. <a href="#Pg039" class="tei tei-ref">39</a>), has delivered on the same subject. It will be

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(both of them writers of the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,) has
the better claim to the authorship of the Homily in question,<a id="noteref_97" name="noteref_97" href="#note_97"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">97</span></span></a>‚Äîwhich,
however, cannot at all events be assigned to the illustrious
Bishop of Nyssa, the brother of Basil the Great. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn the
more accurate copies,‚Äù</span> (says this writer,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Gospel according
to Mark has its end at <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòfor they were afraid.‚Äô</span> In
some copies, however, this also is added,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when He
was risen early the first day of the week, He appeared first
to Mary Magdalene, out of whom He had cast seven devils.‚Äô</span>
This, however, seems to contradict to some extent what we
before delivered; for since it happens that the hour of the
night when our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> rose is not known, how does it come
to be here written that He rose <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly?‚Äô</span> But the saying
will prove to be no ways contradictory, if we read with skill.
We must be careful intelligently to introduce a comma after,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when He was risen:‚Äô</span> and then to proceed,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòEarly in
the Sabbath He appeared first to Mary Magdalene:‚Äô</span> in order
that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòwhen He was risen‚Äô</span> may refer (in conformity with
what Matthew says) to the foregoing season; while <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly‚Äô</span>
is connected with the appearance to Mary.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_98" name="noteref_98" href="#note_98"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">98</span></span></a>‚ÄîI presume it
would be to abuse a reader's patience to offer any remarks
on all this. If a careful perusal of the foregoing passage
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page058">[pg 058]</span><a name="Pg058" id="Pg058" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
does not convince him that Hesychius is here only reproducing
what he had read in Eusebius, nothing that I can say
will persuade him of the fact. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em> indeed are by
no means the same; but the sense is altogether identical.
He seems to have also known the work of Victor of Antioch.
However, to remove all doubt from the reader's mind that
the work of Eusebius was in the hands of Hesychius while
he wrote, I have printed in two parallel columns and transferred
to the Appendix what must needs be conclusive;<a id="noteref_99" name="noteref_99" href="#note_99"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">99</span></span></a> for it will be seen that the terms are only not identical in which
Eusebius and Hesychius discuss that favourite problem with
the ancients,‚Äîthe consistency of S. Matthew's ·ΩÄœà·Ω≤ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ
with the œÄœÅœâ·Ω∑ of S. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is, however, only needful to read through the Homily
in question to see that it is an attempt to weave into one
piece a quantity of foreign and incongruous materials. It is
in fact not a Homily at all, (though it has been thrown into
that form;) but a Dissertation,‚Äîinto which, Hesychius,
(who is known to have been very curious in questions of
that kind<a id="noteref_100" name="noteref_100" href="#note_100"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">100</span></span></a>,) is observed to introduce solutions of most of
those famous difficulties which cluster round the sepulchre of
the world's Redeemer on the morning of the first Easter
Day;<a id="noteref_101" name="noteref_101" href="#note_101"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">101</span></span></a>
and which the ancients seem to have delighted in
discussing,‚Äîas, the number of the Marys who visited the
sepulchre; the angelic appearances on the morning of the
Resurrection; and above all the seeming discrepancy, already
adverted to, in the Evangelical notices of the time at which
our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> rose from the dead. I need not enter more particularly
into an examination of this (so-called) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHomily‚Äù</span>:
but I must not dismiss it without pointing out that its author
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page059">[pg 059]</span><a name="Pg059" id="Pg059" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
at all events cannot be thought to have repudiated the concluding
verses of S. Mark: for at the end of his discourse,
he quotes the 19th verse entire, without hesitation, in confirmation
of one of his statements, and declares that the
words are written by S. Mark.<a id="noteref_102" name="noteref_102" href="#note_102"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">102</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I shall not be thought unreasonable, therefore, if I contend
that Hesychius is no longer to be cited as a witness in this
behalf: if I point out that it is entirely to misunderstand
and misrepresent the case to quote <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a passing allusion of his to
what Eusebius had long before delivered on the same subject</span></em>, as
if it exhibited his own individual teaching. It is
demonstrable<a id="noteref_103" name="noteref_103" href="#note_103"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">103</span></span></a>
that he is not bearing testimony to the condition of
the MSS. of S. Mark's Gospel in his own age: neither, indeed,
is he bearing testimony <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at all</span></em>. He is simply amusing
himself, (in what is found to have been his favourite way,)
with reconciling an apparent discrepancy in the Gospels;
and he does it by adopting certain remarks of Eusebius.
Living so late as the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century; conspicuous
neither for his judgment nor his learning; a copyist only, so far as his
remarks on the last verses of S. Mark's Gospel are concerned;‚Äîthis
writer does not really deserve the space and
attention we have been compelled to bestow upon him.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. We may conclude, by inquiring for the evidence
borne by
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor of Antioch.</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And from the familiar style in which this Father's name
is always introduced into the present discussion, no less than
from the invariable practice of assigning to him the date
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 401,‚Äù</span> it might be supposed that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVictor of
Antioch‚Äù</span> is a well-known personage. Yet is there scarcely a Commentator
of antiquity about whom less is certainly known.
Clinton (who enumerates cccxxii <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEcclesiastical Authors‚Äù</span>
from <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 70 to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>
685<a id="noteref_104" name="noteref_104" href="#note_104"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">104</span></span></a>) does not even record his name.
The recent <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDictionary of Greek and Roman Biography‚Äù</span>
is just as silent concerning him. Cramer (his latest editor)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page060">[pg 060]</span><a name="Pg060" id="Pg060" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
calls his very existence in question; proposing to attribute
his Commentary on S. Mark to Cyril of Alexandria.<a id="noteref_105" name="noteref_105" href="#note_105"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">105</span></span></a>
Not to delay the reader needlessly,‚ÄîVictor of Antioch is an interesting
and unjustly neglected Father of the Church;
whose date,‚Äî(inasmuch as he apparently quotes sometimes
from Cyril of Alexandria who died <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 444, and yet seems
to have written soon after the death of Chrysostom, which
took place <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 407), may be assigned to the first half of the
v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,‚Äîsuppose
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 425-450. And in citing him
I shall always refer to the best (and most easily accessible)
edition of his work,‚Äîthat of Cramer (1840) in the first
volume of his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCatenae.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But a far graver charge is behind. From the confident
air in which Victor's authority is appealed to by those who
deem the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel spurious,
it would of course be inferred that his evidence is hostile
to the verses in question; whereas his evidence to their
genuineness is the most emphatic and extraordinary on
record. Dr. Tregelles asserts that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhis <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">testimony</span></em> to the
absence of these twelve verses from some or many copies,
stands in contrast to his own <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></em> on the subject.‚Äù</span> But
Victor delivers <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúopinion:‚Äù</span> and his <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútestimony‚Äù</span> is the
direct reverse of what Dr. Tregelles asserts it to be. This
learned and respected critic has strangely misapprehended
the evidence.<a id="noteref_106" name="noteref_106" href="#note_106"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">106</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I must needs be brief in this place. I shall therefore
confine myself to those facts concerning <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVictor of Antioch,‚Äù</span>
or rather concerning his work, which are necessary for the
purpose in hand.<a id="noteref_107" name="noteref_107" href="#note_107"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">107</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, his Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel,‚Äîas all must
see who will be at the pains to examine it,‚Äîis to a great
extent a compilation. The same thing may be said, no
doubt, to some extent, of almost every ancient Commentary
in existence. But I mean, concerning this particular work,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page061">[pg 061]</span><a name="Pg061" id="Pg061" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that it proves to have been the author's plan not so much
to give the general results of his acquaintance with the
writings of Origen, Apollinarius, Theodorus of Mopsuestia,
Eusebius, and Chrysostom; as, with or without acknowledgment,
to transcribe largely (but with great license)
from one or other of these writers. Thus, the whole of his
note on S. Mark xv. 38, 39, is taken, without any hint that
it is not original, (much of it, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">word for word</span></em>,) from Chrysostom's
88th Homily on S. Matthew's Gospel.<a id="noteref_108" name="noteref_108" href="#note_108"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">108</span></span></a>
The same is to be said of the first twelve lines of his note on
S. Mark xvi. 9. On the other hand, the latter half of the
note last mentioned professes to give the substance of what
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius</span></em> had written on the same subject. It is in fact an
extract from those very <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúQuaestiones ad Marinum‚Äù</span> concerning
which so much has been offered already. All this,
though it does not sensibly detract from the interest or the
value of Victor's work, must be admitted entirely to change
the character of his supposed evidence. He comes before
us rather in the light of a Compiler than of an Author: his
work is rather a <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCatena‚Äù</span> than a Commentary: and as
such in fact it is generally described. Quite plain is it, at
all events, that the sentiments contained in the sections last
referred to, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not Victor's at all</span></em>. For one half of them,
no one but Chrysostom is responsible: for the other half, no
one but Eusebius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is Victor's familiar use of the writings of Eusebius,‚Äîespecially
of those Resolutions of hard Questions <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúconcerning
the seeming Inconsistencies in the Evangelical accounts
of the Resurrection,‚Äù</span> which Eusebius addressed to Marinus,‚Äîon
which the reader's attention is now to be concentrated.
Victor cites that work of Eusebius <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by name</span></em> in the very
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> page of his Commentary. That his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last</span></em> page also contains
a quotation from it, (also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by name</span></em>), has been already pointed
out.<a id="noteref_109" name="noteref_109" href="#note_109"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">109</span></span></a>
Attention is now invited to what is found concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 in the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last page but one</span></em> (p. 444) of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page062">[pg 062]</span><a name="Pg062" id="Pg062" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Victor's work. It shall be given in English; because I will
convince unlearned as well as learned readers. Victor, (after
quoting four lines from the 89<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Homily of
Chrysostom<a id="noteref_110" name="noteref_110" href="#note_110"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">110</span></span></a>), reconciles (exactly as Eusebius is observed to
do<a id="noteref_111" name="noteref_111" href="#note_111"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">111</span></span></a>) the notes
of time contained severally in S. Matth. xxviii. 1, S. Mark
xvi. 2, S. Luke xxiv. 1, and S. John xx. 1. After which,
he proceeds as follows:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn certain copies of Mark's Gospel, next comes,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow
when [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>] was risen early the first day of the week, He
appeared to Mary Magdalene;‚Äô</span>‚Äîa statement which seems
inconsistent with Matthew's narrative. This might be met
by asserting, that the conclusion of Mark's Gospel, though
found in certain copies, is spurious, However, that we may
not seem to betake ourselves to an off-hand answer, we
propose to read the place thus:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>] was
risen:‚Äô</span> then, after a comma, to go on,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly the first day
of the week He appeared to Mary Magdalene.‚Äô</span> In this
way we refer [Mark's] <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>] was risen‚Äô</span> to
Matthew's <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the sabbath,‚Äô</span> (for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> we believe
Him to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">risen</span></em>;) and all that comes after, expressive as
it is of a different notion, we connect with what follows.
Mark relates that He who <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">arose</span></em> (according to Matthew) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
the end of the Sabbath</span></em>,‚Äô</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was seen</span></em> by Mary Magdalene
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">early</span></em>.‚Äô</span>
This is in fact what John also declares; for he too has recorded
that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly,‚Äô</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòthe first day of the week,‚Äô</span> [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>]
appeared to the Magdalene. In a word, two distinct seasons
are set before us by these words: first, the season of the
Resurrection,‚Äîwhich was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòin the end of the Sabbath;‚Äô</span>
secondly, the season of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Appearing,‚Äîwhich
was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòearly.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_112" name="noteref_112" href="#note_112"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">112</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
No one, I presume, can read this passage and yet hesitate
to admit that he is here listening to Eusebius <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúad Marinum‚Äù</span>
over again. But if any one really retains a particle
of doubt on the subject, he is requested to cast his eye to
the foot of the present page; and even an unlearned reader,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page063">[pg 063]</span><a name="Pg063" id="Pg063" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
surveying the originals with attention, may easily convince
himself that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Victor is here nothing else but a
copyist</span></em>.<a id="noteref_113" name="noteref_113" href="#note_113"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">113</span></span></a>
That the work in which Eusebius reconciles <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúseeming discrepancies
in the Evangelical narratives,‚Äù</span> was actually lying open
before Victor while he wrote, is ascertained beyond dispute.
He is observed in his next ensuing Comment to quote from
it, and to mention Eusebius as its author. At the end of
the present note he has a significant allusion to Eusebius:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page064">[pg 064]</span><a name="Pg064" id="Pg064" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
know very well,‚Äù</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhat has been suggested <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by
those who are at the pains to remove the apparent inconsistencies
in this place</span></em>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_114" name="noteref_114" href="#note_114"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">114</span></span></a>
But when writing on S. Mark xvi. 9-20,
he does more. After abridging, (as his manner is,) what
Eusebius explains with such tedious emphasis, (giving the
substance of five columns in about three times as many
lines,) he adopts the exact expressions of Eusebius,‚Äîfollows
him in his very mistakes,‚Äîand finally transcribes his words.
The reader is therefore requested to bear in mind that what
he has been listening to is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not the testimony of Victor at all</span></em>:
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the testimony of Eusebius</span></em>. This is but one more echo
therefore of a passage of which we are all beginning by this
time to be weary; so exceedingly rash are the statements
with which it is introduced, so utterly preposterous the proposed
method of remedying a difficulty which proves after
all to be purely imaginary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> the testimony of Victor? Does he offer any
independent statement on the question in dispute, from
which his own private opinion (though nowhere stated) may
be lawfully inferred? Yes indeed. Victor, though frequently
a Transcriber only, is observed every now and then
to come forward in his own person, and deliver his individual
sentiment.<a id="noteref_115" name="noteref_115" href="#note_115"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">115</span></span></a>
But nowhere throughout his work
does he deliver such remarkable testimony as in this place.
Hear him!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNotwithstanding that in very many copies of the present
Gospel, the passage beginning, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>] was risen
early the first day of the week, He appeared first to Mary Magdalene,‚Äô</span>

be spurious,)‚Äîyet <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">we</span></span>, at all events,
inasmuch as in very many we have discovered it to exist, have, out of accurate
copies, subjoined also the account of our Lord's
Ascension, (following the words <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòfor they were afraid,‚Äô</span>)
in conformity with the Palestinian exemplar of Mark
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page065">[pg 065]</span><a name="Pg065" id="Pg065" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which exhibits the Gospel verity: that is to say, from
the words, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòNow when [Jesus] was risen early the

these words Victor of Antioch brings his Commentary on S. Mark to an end.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Here then we find it roundly stated by a highly intelligent
Father, writing in the first half of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century,‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) That the reason why the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark
are absent from some ancient copies of his Gospel is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because
they have been deliberately omitted by Copyists</span></em>:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) That the ground for such omission was the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subjective
judgment</span></em> of individuals,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> the result of any appeal to
documentary evidence. Victor, therefore, clearly held that
the Verses in question had been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expunged</span></em> in consequence of
their (seeming) inconsistency with what is met with in the
other Gospels:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) That he, on the other hand, had convinced himself
by reference to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúvery many‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaccurate‚Äù</span> copies, that
the verses in question are genuine:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) That in particular the Palestinian Copy, which enjoyed
the reputation of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúexhibiting the genuine text of
S. Mark,‚Äù</span> contained the Verses in dispute.‚ÄîTo <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Opinion</span></em>,
therefore, Victor opposes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Authority</span></em>. He makes his appeal
to the most trustworthy documentary evidence with which
he is acquainted; and the deliberate testimony which he
delivers is a complete counterpoise and antidote to the loose
phrases of Eusebius on the same subject:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5.) That in consequence of all this, following the Palestinian
Exemplar, he had from accurate copies <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">furnished his
own work with the Twelve Verses in dispute</span></em>;‚Äîwhich is a categorical
refutation of the statement frequently met with that
the work of Victor of Antioch is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We are now at liberty to sum up; and to review the progress
which has been hitherto made in this Inquiry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Six Fathers of the Church have been examined who are
commonly represented as bearing hostile testimony to the
last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel; and they have been
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page066">[pg 066]</span><a name="Pg066" id="Pg066" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
easily reduced to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>. Three of them, (Hesychius, Jerome,
Victor,) prove to be echoes, not voices. The remaining two,
(Gregory of Nyssa and Severus,) are neither voices nor
echoes, but merely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">names</span></em>: <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Gregory of Nyssa</span></span> having
really no more to do with this discussion than Philip of Macedon;
and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHesychius‚Äù</span> representing one and the
same individual. Only by a Critic seeking to mislead his
reader will any one of these five Fathers be in future cited
as witnessing against the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
Eusebius is the solitary witness who survives the ordeal of
exact inquiry.<a id="noteref_117" name="noteref_117" href="#note_117"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">117</span></span></a> But,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>, (as we have seen), instead of proclaiming his
distrust of this portion of the Gospel, enters upon an elaborate
proof that its contents are not inconsistent with what
is found in the Gospels of S. Matthew and S. John. His
testimony is reducible to two innocuous and wholly unconnected
propositions: the first,‚ÄîThat there existed in his
day a vast number of copies in which the last chapter of
S. Mark's Gospel ended abruptly at ver. 8; (the correlative
of which of course would be that there also existed a vast
number which were furnished with the present ending.) The
second,‚ÄîThat by putting a comma after the word ·ºàŒΩŒ±œÉœÑ·Ω±œÇ,
S. Mark xvi. 9, is capable of being reconciled with S. Matth.
xxviii. 1<a id="noteref_118" name="noteref_118" href="#note_118"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">118</span></span></a>....
I profess myself unable to understand how
it can be pretended that Eusebius would have subscribed to
the opinion of Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest, that the
Gospel of S. Mark was never finished by its inspired Author,
or was mutilated before it came abroad; at all events, that
the last Twelve Verses are spurious.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page067">[pg 067]</span><a name="Pg067" id="Pg067" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. The observations of Eusebius are found to have been
adopted, and in part transcribed, by an unknown writer of
the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,‚Äîwhether
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Hesychius</span></span> or <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Severus</span></span> is not certainly
known: but if it were Hesychius, then it was not
Severus; if Severus, then not Hesychius. This writer, however,
(whoever he may have been,) is careful to convince us
that individually he entertained <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no doubt whatever</span></em> about the
genuineness of this part of Scripture, for he says that he
writes in order to remove the (hypothetical) objections of
others, and to silence their (imaginary) doubts. Nay, he
freely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quotes the verses as genuine</span></em>, and declares that they were
read in his day on a certain Sunday night in the public
Service of the Church.... To represent such an one,‚Äî(it
matters nothing, I repeat, whether we call him <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHesychius
of Jerusalem‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeverus of Antioch,‚Äù</span>)‚Äîas a hostile witness,
is simply to misrepresent the facts of the case. He is,
on the contrary, the strenuous champion of the verses which
he is commonly represented as impugning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. As for <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jerome</span></span>, since that illustrious Father comes
before us in this place as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">translator</span></em> of Eusebius only, he is
no more responsible for what Eusebius says concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, than Hobbes of Malmesbury is responsible
for anything that Thucydides has related concerning
the Peloponnesian war. Individually, however, it is certain
that Jerome was convinced of the genuineness of S. Mark
xvi. 9-20: for in two different places of his writings he not
only quotes the 9th and 14th verses, but he exhibits all the
twelve in the Vulgate.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Lastly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor of Antioch</span></span>, who wrote in an age when
Eusebius was held to be an infallible oracle on points of
Biblical Criticism,‚Äîhaving dutifully rehearsed, (like the
rest,) the feeble expedient of that illustrious Father for harmonizing
S. Mark xvi. 9 with the narrative of S. Matthew,‚Äîis
observed to cite the statements of Eusebius concerning
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last Twelve Verses</span></em> of S. Mark, only in order to refute
them. Not that he opposes opinion to opinion,‚Äî(for the
opinions of Eusebius and of Victor of Antioch on this behalf
were probably identical;) but statement he meets with
counter-statement,‚Äîfact he confronts with fact. Scarcely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page068">[pg 068]</span><a name="Pg068" id="Pg068" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
can anything be imagined more emphatic than his testimony,
or more conclusive.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For the reader is requested to observe that here is an
Ecclesiastic, writing in the first half of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century, who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">expressly witnesses to the genuineness</span></em> of the Verses in
dispute. He had made reference, he says, and ascertained their
existence in very many MSS. (·Ω°œÇ ·ºêŒΩ œÄŒªŒµ·Ω∑œÉœÑŒøŒπœÇ). He had
derived his text from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaccurate‚Äù</span> ones: (·ºêŒæ ·ºÄŒ∫œÅŒπŒ≤·ø∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒπŒ≥œÅ·Ω±œÜœâŒΩ.)
More than that: he leads his reader to infer that
he had personally resorted to the famous Palestinian Copy,
the text of which was held to exhibit the inspired verity,
and had satisfied himself that the concluding section of S.
Mark's Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was there</span></em>. He had, therefore, been either to Jerusalem,
or else to C√¶sarea; had inquired for those venerable
records which had once belonged to Origen and Pamphilus;<a id="noteref_119" name="noteref_119" href="#note_119"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">119</span></span></a>
and had inspected them. Testimony more express, more
weighty,‚ÄîI was going to say, more decisive,‚Äîcan scarcely
be imagined. It may with truth be said to close the present
discussion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
With this, in fact, Victor lays down his pen. So also
may I. I submit that nothing whatever which has hitherto
come before us lends the slightest countenance to the modern
dream that S. Mark's Gospel, as it left the hands of its inspired
Author, ended abruptly at ver. 8. Neither Eusebius
nor Jerome; neither Severus of Antioch nor Hesychius of
Jerusalem; certainly not Victor of Antioch; least of all
Gregory of Nyssa,‚Äîyield a particle of support to that monstrous
fancy. The notion is an invention, a pure imagination
of the Critics ever since the days of Griesbach.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains to be seen whether the MSS. will prove somewhat
less unaccommodating.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. For it can be of no possible avail, at this stage of
the discussion, to appeal to
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Euthymius Zigabenus</span></span>,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
the Author of an interesting Commentary, or rather Compilation
on the Gospels, assigned to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 1116. Euthymius lived,
in fact, full five hundred years too late for his testimony to
be of the slightest importance. Such as it is, however, it is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page069">[pg 069]</span><a name="Pg069" id="Pg069" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not unfavourable. He says,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSome of the Commentators
state that here,‚Äù</span> (viz. at ver. 8,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Gospel according to
Mark finishes; and that what follows is a spurious addition.‚Äù</span>
(Which clearly is his version of the statements of one
or more of the four Fathers whose testimony has already
occupied so large a share of our attention.) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis portion we
must also interpret, however,‚Äù</span> (Euthymius proceeds,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsince
there is nothing in it prejudicial to the truth.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_120" name="noteref_120" href="#note_120"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">120</span></span></a>‚ÄîBut it is
idle to linger over such a writer. One might almost as well
quote <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPoli <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Synopsis</span></span>‚Äù</span> and then proceed to discuss it. The
cause must indeed be desperate which seeks support from
a quarter like this. What possible sanction can an Ecclesiastic
of the xii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century be supposed to yield to the
hypothesis that S. Mark's Gospel, as it left the hands of its inspired
Author, was an unfinished work?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It remains to ascertain what is the evidence of the MSS.
on this subject. And the MSS. require to be the more
attentively studied, because it is to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em> that our opponents
are accustomed most confidently to appeal. On them in
fact they rely. The nature and the value of the most ancient
Manuscript testimony available, shall be scrupulously investigated
in the next two Chapters.

The two oldest Copies of the Gospels in existence are the
famous Codex in the Vatican Library at Rome, known as
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCodex B;‚Äù</span> and the Codex which Tischendorf brought from
Mount Sinai in 1859, and which he designates by the first letter
of the Hebrew alphabet (◊ê). These two manuscripts are
probably not of equal antiquity.<a id="noteref_121" name="noteref_121" href="#note_121"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">121</span></span></a>
An interval of fifty years
at least seems to be required to account for the marked difference
between them. If the first belongs to the beginning,
the second may be referred to the middle or latter part of
the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century. But the two
Manuscripts agree in this,‚Äîthat
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they are without the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>.
In both, after ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ (ver. 8), comes the subscription:
in Cod. B,‚ÄîŒöŒëŒ§Œë ŒúŒëŒ°ŒöŒüŒù; in Cod. ◊ê,‚ÄîŒïŒ•ŒëŒìŒìŒïŒõŒôŒüŒù ŒöŒëŒ§Œë
ŒúŒëŒ°ŒöŒüŒù.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let it not be supposed that we have any <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> facts of this
class to produce. All has been stated. It is not that the
evidence of Manuscripts is one,‚Äîthe evidence of Fathers
and Versions another. The very reverse is the case. Manuscripts,
Fathers, and Versions alike, are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only not unanimous</span></em>
in bearing consistent testimony. But the consentient witness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page071">[pg 071]</span><a name="Pg071" id="Pg071" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the MSS. is even extraordinary. With the exception of
the two uncial MSS. which have just been named, there is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> Codex in existence, uncial or cursive,‚Äî(and we are
acquainted with, at least, eighteen other uncials,<a id="noteref_122" name="noteref_122" href="#note_122"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">122</span></span></a> and about
six hundred cursive Copies of this Gospel,)‚Äîwhich leaves out
the last twelve verses of S. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The inference which an unscientific observer would draw
from this fact, is no doubt in this instance the correct one.
He demands to be shewn the Alexandrine (A) and the Parisian
Codex (C),‚Äîneither of them probably removed by much
more than fifty years from the date of the Codex Sinaiticus,
and both unquestionably <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">derived from different originals</span></em>;‚Äîand
he ascertains that no countenance is lent by either of
those venerable monuments to the proposed omission of this
part of the sacred text. He discovers that the Codex Bezae
(D), the only remaining very ancient MS. authority,‚Äînotwithstanding
that it is observed on most occasions to exhibit
an extraordinary sympathy with the Vatican (B),‚Äîhere sides
with A and C against B and ◊ê. He inquires after all the
other uncials and all the cursive MSS. in existence, (some
of them dating from the x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,) and
requests to have it explained to him <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> it is to be supposed that all these
many witnesses,‚Äîbelonging to so many different patriarchates,
provinces, ages of the Church,‚Äîhave entered into
a grand conspiracy to bear false witness on a point of this
magnitude and importance? But he obtains no intelligible
answer to this question. How, then, is an unprejudiced
student to draw any inference but one from the premisses?
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> single peculiarity (he tells himself) of bringing the
second Gospel abruptly to a close at the 8th verse of the
xvi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> chapter, is absolutely fatal to the two
Codices in question. It is useless to din into his ears that those Codices
are probably both of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century,‚Äîunless men are prepared to add the assurance that a Codex of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of necessity</span></em>
a more trustworthy witness to the text of the
Gospels than a Codex of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>. The omission of
these twelve verses, I repeat, in itself, destroys his confidence in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page072">[pg 072]</span><a name="Pg072" id="Pg072" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê: for it is obvious that a copy of the Gospels
which has been so seriously mutilated in one place may
have been slightly tampered with in another. He is willing
to suspend his judgment, of course. The two oldest copies of
the Gospels in existence are entitled to great reverence <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">because</span></em>
of their high antiquity. They must be allowed a most
patient, most unprejudiced, most respectful, nay, a most
indulgent hearing. But when all this has been freely accorded,
on no intelligible principle can more be claimed for
any two MSS. in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The rejoinder to all this is sufficiently obvious. Mistrust
will no doubt have been thrown over the evidence borne to
the text of Scripture in a thousand other places by Cod. B
and Cod. ◊ê, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after demonstration that those two Codices exhibit
a mutilated text</span></em> in the present place. But what else is this
but the very point requiring demonstration? Why may
not these two be right, and all the other MSS. wrong?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I propose, therefore, that we reverse the process. Proceed
we to examine the evidence borne by these two witnesses
on certain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> occasions which admit of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> difference of
opinion; or next to none. Let us endeavour, I say, to ascertain
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the character of the Witnesses</span></em> by a patient and unprejudiced
examination of their Evidence,‚Äînot in one place,
or in two, or in three; but on several important occasions,
and throughout. If we find it invariably consentient and
invariably truthful, then of course a mighty presumption
will have been established, the very strongest possible, that
their adverse testimony in respect of the conclusion of
S. Mark's Gospel must needs be worthy of all acceptation.
But if, on the contrary, our inquiries shall conduct us to
the very opposite result,‚Äîwhat else can happen but that
our confidence in these two MSS. will be hopelessly shaken?
We must in such case be prepared to admit that it is just
as likely as not that this is only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one more occasion</span></em> on which
these <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútwo false witnesses‚Äù</span> have conspired to witness falsely.
If, at this juncture, extraneous evidence of an entirely trustworthy
kind can be procured to confront them: above all,
if some one ancient witness of unimpeachable veracity can
be found who shall bear contradictory evidence: what other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page073">[pg 073]</span><a name="Pg073" id="Pg073" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
alternative will be left us but to reject their testimony in
respect of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 with something like indignation;
and to acquiesce in the belief of universal Christendom
for eighteen hundred years that these twelve verses are
just as much entitled to our unhesitating acceptance as any
other twelve verses in the Gospel which can be named?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. It is undeniable, in the meantime, that for the last
quarter of a century, it has become the fashion to demand
for the readings of Codex B something very like absolute
deference. The grounds for this superstitious sentiment,
(for really I can describe it in no apter way,) I profess
myself unable to discover. Codex B comes to us without
a history: without recommendation of any kind, except that
of its antiquity. It bears traces of careless transcription in
every page. The mistakes which the original transcriber
made are of perpetual recurrence. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThey are chiefly omissions,
of one, two, or three words; but sometimes of half
a verse, a whole verse, or even of several verses.... I hesitate
not to assert that it would be easier to find a folio containing
three or four such omissions than to light on one
which should be without
any.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_123" name="noteref_123" href="#note_123"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">123</span></span></a> In the Gospels alone,
Codex B leaves out words or whole clauses no less than
1,491 times:<a id="noteref_124" name="noteref_124" href="#note_124"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">124</span></span></a> of which by far the largest proportion is
found in S. Mark's Gospel. Many of these, no doubt, are
to be accounted for by the proximity of a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlike
ending.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_125" name="noteref_125" href="#note_125"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">125</span></span></a>
The Vatican MS. (like the Sinaitic<a id="noteref_126" name="noteref_126" href="#note_126"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">126</span></span></a>) was originally derived
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page074">[pg 074]</span><a name="Pg074" id="Pg074" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
from an older Codex which contained about twelve
or thirteen letters in a line.<a id="noteref_127" name="noteref_127" href="#note_127"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">127</span></span></a> And it will be found that
some of its omissions which have given rise to prolonged
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page075">[pg 075]</span><a name="Pg075" id="Pg075" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discussion are probably to be referred to nothing else but the
oscitancy of a transcriber with such a codex before him:<a id="noteref_128" name="noteref_128" href="#note_128"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">128</span></span></a>
without having recourse to any more abstruse hypothesis;
without any imputation of bad faith;‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly without
supposing that the words omitted did not exist in the inspired
autograph of the Evangelist</span></em>. But then it is undeniable that
some of the omissions in Cod. B are not to be so explained.
On the other hand, I can testify to the fact that the codex
is disfigured throughout with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repetitions</span></em>. The original scribe
is often found to have not only written the same words twice
over, but to have failed whenever he did so to take any
notice with his pen of what he had done.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What then, (I must again inquire,) are the grounds for
the superstitious reverence which is entertained in certain
quarters for the readings of Codex B? If it be a secret
known to the recent Editors of the New Testament, they
have certainly contrived to keep it wondrous close.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. More recently, a claim to co-ordinate primacy has
been set up on behalf of the Codex Sinaiticus. Tischendorf
is actually engaged in remodelling his seventh Leipsic edition,
chiefly in conformity with the readings of his lately
discovered MS.<a id="noteref_129" name="noteref_129" href="#note_129"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">129</span></span></a> And yet the Codex in question abounds
with <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúerrors of the the eye and pen, to an extent not unparalleled,
but happily rather unusual in documents of first-rate
importance.‚Äù</span> On many occasions, 10, 20, 30, 40 words
are dropped through very carelessness.<a id="noteref_130" name="noteref_130" href="#note_130"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">130</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLetters and words, even whole sentences, are frequently written twice
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page076">[pg 076]</span><a name="Pg076" id="Pg076" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
over, or begun and immediately cancelled: while that gross
blunder ... whereby a clause is omitted because it happens to
end in the same words as the clause preceding, occurs no less
than 115 times in the New Testament. Tregelles has freely
pronounced that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòthe state of the text, as proceeding from
the first scribe, may be regarded as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very
rough</span></em>.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_131" name="noteref_131" href="#note_131"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">131</span></span></a> But
when <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe first scribe‚Äù</span> and his <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúvery rough‚Äù</span> performance
have been thus unceremoniously disposed of, one would
like to be informed what remains to command respect in
Codex ◊ê? Is, then, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">manuscript authority</span></em> to be confounded
with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">editorial caprice</span></em>,‚Äîexercising itself upon the corrections
of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúat least ten different revisers,‚Äù</span> who, from the
vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> to the
xii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, have been endeavouring to lick into
shape a text which its original author left <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very rough</span></em>?‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The co-ordinate primacy, (as I must needs call it,) which,
within the last few years, has been claimed for Codex B
and Codex ◊ê, threatens to grow into a species of tyranny,‚Äîfrom
which I venture to predict there will come in the end
an unreasonable and unsalutary recoil. It behoves us, therefore,
to look closely into this matter, and to require a reason
for what is being done. The text of the sacred deposit is
far too precious a thing to be sacrificed to an irrational, or
at least a superstitious devotion to two MSS.,‚Äîsimply because
they may possibly be older by a hundred years than
any other which we possess. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúId verius quod prius,‚Äù</span> is an
axiom which holds every bit as true in Textual Criticism as
in Dogmatic Truth. But on that principle, (as I have already
shewn,) the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel are fully
established;<a id="noteref_132" name="noteref_132" href="#note_132"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">132</span></span></a> and by consequence, the credit of Codd. B
and ◊ê sustains a severe shock. Again, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúId verius quod
prius;‚Äù</span> but it does not of course follow that a Codex of
the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century shall
exhibit a more correct text of Scripture than one written in the
v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>, or even than one written
in the x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>. For the proof of this
statement, (if it can be supposed
to require proof,) it is enough to appeal to Codex D.
That venerable copy of the Gospels is of the
vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page077">[pg 077]</span><a name="Pg077" id="Pg077" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
It is, in fact, one of our five great uncials. No older MS. of
the Greek Text is known to exist,‚Äîexcepting always A, B, C
and ◊ê. And yet <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> text is more thoroughly disfigured by
corruptions and interpolations than that of Codex D. In the
Acts, (to use the language of its learned and accurate Editor,)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúit is hardly an exaggeration to assert that it reproduces
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">textus receptus</span></em> much in the same way that one of the
best Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew of the Old Testament:
so wide are the variations in the diction, so constant
and inveterate the practice of expanding the narrative by
means of interpolations which seldom recommend themselves
as genuine by even a semblance of internal
probability.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_133" name="noteref_133" href="#note_133"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">133</span></span></a> Where, then, is the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">√† priori</span></span>
probability that two MSS. of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century shall have not only a superior claim to be heard,
but almost an exclusive right to dictate which readings are
to be rejected, which retained?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How ready the most recent editors of the New Testament
have shewn themselves to hammer the sacred text on the
anvil of Codd. B and ◊ê,‚Äînot unfrequently in defiance of the
evidence of all other MSS., and sometimes to the serious
detriment of the deposit,‚Äîwould admit of striking illustration
were this place for such details. Tischendorf's English
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">New Testament</span></em>‚Äù</span>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwith various readings from the three
most celebrated manuscripts of the Greek Text‚Äù</span> translated
at the foot of every page,‚Äîis a recent attempt (1869) to
popularize the doctrine that we have to look exclusively to
two or three of the oldest copies, if we would possess the
Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> in its integrity. Dean Alford's constant appeal
in his revision of the Authorized Version (1870) to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
oldest MSS.‚Äù</span> (meaning thereby generally Codd. ◊ê and B
with one or two others<a id="noteref_134" name="noteref_134" href="#note_134"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">134</span></span></a>), is
an abler endeavour to familiarize the public mind with the same belief. I am bent on
shewing that there is nothing whatever in the character of
either of the Codices in question to warrant this servile
deference.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) And first,‚ÄîOught it not sensibly to detract from our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page078">[pg 078]</span><a name="Pg078" id="Pg078" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
opinion of the value of their evidence to discover that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is
easier to find two consecutive verses in which the two MSS. differ,
the one from the other, than two consecutive verses in which they
entirely agree</span></em>? Now this is a plain matter of fact, of which
any one who pleases may easily convince himself. But the
character of two witnesses who habitually contradict one
another has been accounted, in every age, precarious. On
every such occasion, only one of them can possibly be speaking
the truth. Shall I be thought unreasonable if I confess
that these <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perpetual</span></em> inconsistencies between Codd. B
and ◊ê,‚Äîgrave inconsistencies, and occasionally even gross
ones,‚Äîaltogether destroy my confidence in either?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) On the other hand, discrepant as the testimony of
these two MSS. is throughout, they yet, strange to say,
conspire every here and there in exhibiting minute corruptions
of such an unique and peculiar kind as to betray
a (probably not very remote) common corrupt original.
These coincidences in fact are so numerous and so extraordinary
as to establish a real connexion between those two
codices; and that connexion is fatal to any claim which
might be set up on their behalf as wholly independent
witnesses.<a id="noteref_135" name="noteref_135" href="#note_135"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">135</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Further, it is evident that both alike have been subjected,
probably during the process of transcription, to the
same depraving influences. But because such statements
require to be established by an induction of instances, the
reader's attention must now be invited to a few samples of
the grave blemishes which disfigure our two oldest copies
of the Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. And first, since it is the omission of the end of S. Mark's
Gospel which has given rise to the present discussion, it
becomes a highly significant circumstance that the original
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page079">[pg 079]</span><a name="Pg079" id="Pg079" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
scribe of Cod. ◊ê had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> omitted the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">end of the Gospel according
to S. John</span></em>.<a id="noteref_136" name="noteref_136" href="#note_136"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">136</span></span></a>
In this suppression of ver. 25, Cod. ◊ê stands
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> among MSS. A cloud of primitive witnesses vouch
for the genuineness of the verse. Surely, it is nothing else
but the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">reductio ad absurdum</span></span> of a theory of recension, (with
Tischendorf in his last edition,) to accommodate our printed
text to the vicious standard of the original penman of Cod. ◊ê
and bring the last chapter of S. John's Gospel to a close
at ver. 24!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cod. B, on the other hand, omits the whole of those two
solemn verses wherein S. Luke describes our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAgony
and bloody Sweat,‚Äù</span> together with the act of the ministering
Angel.<a id="noteref_137" name="noteref_137" href="#note_137"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">137</span></span></a> As to the genuineness of those verses,
recognised as they are by Justin Martyr, Iren√¶us, Hippolytus, Epiphanius,
Didymus, Gregory of Nazianzus, Chrysostom, Theodoret,
by all the oldest versions, and by almost every MS.
in existence, including Cod. ◊ê,‚Äîit admits of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> doubt. Here
then is proof positive that in order to account for omissions
from the Gospel in the oldest of the uncials, there is no need
whatever to resort to the hypothesis that such portions of
the Gospel are not the genuine work of the Evangelist.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe admitted error of Cod. B in this place,‚Äù</span> (to quote the
words of Scrivener,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúought to make some of its advocates
more chary of their confidence in cases where it is less
countenanced by other witnesses than in the instance before
us.‚Äù</span>
</p>

Cod. B (not Cod. ◊ê) is further guilty of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgrave error‚Äù</span>

omissions were made. All that is asserted is, that they cannot
be imputed to the carelessness of a copyist, but were
intentional: and I insist that they effectually dispose of the
presumption that when an important passage is observed to
be wanting from Cod. B or Cod. ◊ê, its absence is to be accounted
for by assuming that it was also absent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from the

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. To the foregoing must be added the many places where
the text of B or of ◊ê, or of both, has clearly been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interpolated</span></em>.
There does not exist in the whole compass of the New Testament
a more monstrous instance of this than is furnished
by the transfer of the incident of the piercing of our Redeemer's
side from S. John xix. 24 to S. Matth. xxvii., in
Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê, where it is introduced at the end of

But the inspired text has been depraved in the same
licentious way throughout, by the responsible authors of

3. Not a few of the foregoing instances are in fact of a kind
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page082">[pg 082]</span><a name="Pg082" id="Pg082" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to convince me that the text with which Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê

subjected to a clumsy process of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">revision</span></em>. Not unfrequently,
as may be imagined, the result (however tasteless and infelicitous)
is not of serious importance; as when, (to give
examples from Cod. ◊ê,) for œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ΩÑœáŒªŒøŒΩ ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∫Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∑ (in

But it requires very little acquaintance with the subject to
foresee that this kind of license may easily assume serious
dimensions, and grow into an intolerable evil. Thus, when
the man born blind is asked by the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy One</span></span> if he believes
·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ œÖ·º±·Ω∏ŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶ ŒòŒµŒø·ø¶ (S. John. ix. 35), we are by no means

Œ∫Œ±Œπ ŒµŒºŒøŒπ Œ±œÖœÑŒøœÖœÇ ŒµŒ¥œâŒ∫Œ±œÉ any equivalent at all for Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∞ ·ºêŒº·Ω∞
œÄ·Ω±ŒΩœÑŒ± œÉ·Ω± ·ºêœÉœÑŒπ, Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∞ œÉ·Ω∞ ·ºêŒº·Ω± in S. John xvii. 10: or, Œ±ŒªŒªŒøŒπ

even when our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> is not the speaker, such licentious
depravation of the text is not to be endured. Thus, in
S. Luke xxiii. 15, Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê conspire in substituting

œÄœÅŒøœÇ Œ∑ŒºŒ±œÇ; which leads one to suspect the copyist was
misled by the narrative in ver. 7. Similar instances might
be multiplied to an indefinite extent.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Two yet graver corruptions of the truth of the Gospel,
(but they belong to the same category,) remain to be specified.
Mindful, I suppose, of S. James' explanation <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhow
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by works</span></em> a man is justified,‚Äù</span> the author of the text of
Codices B and ◊ê has ventured to alter our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s assertion
(in S. Matth. xi. 19,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWisdom is justified of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her children</span></em>,‚Äù</span>
into <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWisdom is justified by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her works</span></em>;‚Äù</span> and, in the case
of Cod. ◊ê, his zeal is observed to have so entirely carried
him away, that he has actually substituted ŒµœÅŒ≥œâŒΩ for œÑ·Ω≥Œ∫ŒΩœâŒΩ
in the parallel place of S. Luke's Gospel.‚ÄîThe other example
of error (S. Matth. xxi. 31) is calculated to provoke
a smile. Finding that our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>, in describing the conduct
of the two sons in the parable, says of the one,‚Äî·ΩïœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ
Œ¥·Ω≤ ŒºŒµœÑŒ±ŒºŒµŒªŒ∑Œ∏Œµ·Ω∂œÇ ·ºÄœÄ·øÜŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ, and of the other,‚ÄîŒ∫Œ±·Ω∂
Œø·ΩêŒ∫ ·ºÄœÄ·øÜŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ; some ancient scribe, (who can have been but
slenderly acquainted with the Greek language,) seems to
have conceived the notion that a more precise way of identifying
the son who <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">afterwards</span></em> repented and went,‚Äù</span> would
be to designate him as ·ΩÅ ·ΩïœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ. Accordingly, in reply to
the question,‚ÄîœÑ·Ω∑œÇ ·ºêŒ∫ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œ¥·ΩªŒø ·ºêœÄŒø·Ω∑Œ∑œÉŒµŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∏·Ω≥ŒªŒ∑ŒºŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ œÄŒ±œÑœÅ·ΩπœÇ;
we are presented (but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only in Cod.</span></em> B) with the astonishing
information,‚ÄîŒªŒµŒ≥ŒøœÖœÉŒπŒΩ Œø œÖœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ. And yet, seeing
clearly that this made nonsense of the parable, some
subsequent critic is found to have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transposed the order of the
two sons</span></em>: and in that queer condition the parable comes
down to us in the famous Vatican Codex B.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Some of the foregoing instances of infelicitous tampering
with the text of the Gospels are, it must be confessed,
very serious. But it is a yet more fatal circumstance in
connexion with Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê that they are convicted
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page084">[pg 084]</span><a name="Pg084" id="Pg084" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of certain perversions of the truth of Scripture which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must</span></em>
have been made with deliberation and purpose. Thus, in
S. Mark xiv, they exhibit a set of passages‚Äî(verses 30, 68,
72)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhich bear clear marks of wilful and critical correction,
thoroughly carried out in Cod. ◊ê, only partially in Cod. B;
the object being so far to assimilate the narrative of Peter's
denial with those of the other Evangelists, as to suppress
the fact, vouched for by S. Mark only, that the cock crowed
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em>. (In Cod. ◊ê, Œ¥·Ω∑œÇ is omitted in ver. 30,<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò‚Äî·ºêŒ∫ Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑ·Ω≥œÅŒøœÖ

discovery, I take leave to point out, is enough to destroy
all confidence in the text of these two manuscripts: for it
proves that another kind of corrupting influence,‚Äîbesides
carelessness, and accident, and tasteless presumption, and
unskilful assiduity,‚Äîhas been at work on Codices B and ◊ê.
We are constrained to approach these two manuscripts with
suspicion in all cases where a supposed critical difficulty in
harmonizing the statements of the several Evangelists will
account for any of the peculiar readings which they exhibit.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Accordingly, it does not at all surprise me to discover
that in both Codices the important word ·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∏Œø·ø¶œÉŒ±Œπ (in
S. Matth. xxviii. 8) has been altered into Œ±œÄŒµŒªŒ∏ŒøœÖœÉŒ±Œπ. I
recognise in that substitution of Œ±œÄŒø for ·ºîŒæ the hand of one
who was not aware that the women, when addressed by the
Angel, were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">inside the sepulchre</span></em>; but who accepted the belief
(it is found to have been as common in ancient as in
modern times) that they beheld him <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsitting on the

consequence of a similar misconception, both Codices
are observed to present us with the word <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wine</span></em>‚Äù</span> instead of
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">vinegar</span></em>‚Äù</span> in S. Matthew's phrase ·ΩÑŒæŒøœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œáŒøŒª·øÜœÇ ŒºŒµŒºŒΩŒ≥Œº·Ω≥ŒΩŒøŒΩ:
which results from a mistaken endeavour on the
part of some ancient critic to bring S. Matth. xxvii. 34 into
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page085">[pg 085]</span><a name="Pg085" id="Pg085" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
harmony with S. Mark xv. 23. The man did not perceive
that the cruel insult of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúvinegar and gall‚Äù</span> (which the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> tasted but would not drink) was quite a distinct
thing from the proffered mercy of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmyrrhed wine‚Äù</span>
which the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> put away from Himself altogether.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So again, it was in order to bring S. Luke xxiv. 13 into
harmony with a supposed fact of geography that Cod. ◊ê
states that Emmaus, (which Josephus also places at sixty
stadia from Jerusalem), was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an hundred</span></em> and sixty‚Äù</span> stadia
distant. The history of this interpolation of the text is
known. It is because some ancient critic (Origen probably)
erroneously assumed that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nicopolis</span></em> was the place intended.
The conjecture met with favour, and there are not wanting
scholia to declare that this was the reading of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe accurate‚Äù</span>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. We are by this time in a condition to form a truer
estimate of the value of the testimony borne by these two
manuscripts in respect of the last twelve verses of S. Mark's
Gospel. If we were disposed before to regard their omission
of an important passage as a serious matter, we certainly
cannot any longer so regard it. We have by this time seen
enough to disabuse our minds of every prejudice. Codd. B
and ◊ê are the very reverse of infallible guides. Their deflections
from the Truth of Scripture are more constant, as
well as more licentious by far, than those of their younger
brethren: their unauthorized omissions from the sacred text
are not only far more frequent but far more flagrant also.
And yet the main matter before us,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their omission of the last
twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>,‚Äîwhen rightly understood,
proves to be an entirely different phenomenon from what an
ordinary reader might have been led to suppose. Attention
is specially requested for the remarks which follow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. To say that in the Vatican Codex (B), which is unquestionably
the oldest we possess, S. Mark's Gospel ends
abruptly at the 8th verse of the xvi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
chapter, and that the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page087">[pg 087]</span><a name="Pg087" id="Pg087" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
customary subscription (ŒöŒëŒ§Œë ŒúŒëŒ°ŒöŒüŒù) follows,‚Äîis true; but
it is far from being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the whole</span></em> truth. It requires to be stated
in addition that the scribe, whose plan is found to have been
to begin every fresh book of the Bible at the top of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the next
ensuing column</span></em> to that which contained the concluding words
of the preceding book, has at the close of S. Mark's Gospel
deviated from his else invariable practice. He has left in
this place one column entirely vacant. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only vacant
column</span></em> in the whole manuscript;‚Äîa blank space <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abundantly
sufficient to contain the twelve verses which he nevertheless withheld.
Why</span></em> did he leave that column vacant? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></em> can have
induced the scribe on this solitary occasion to depart from
his established rule? The phenomenon,‚Äî(I believe I was the
first to call distinct attention to it,)‚Äîis in the highest degree
significant, and admits of only one interpretation. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The
older MS.</span></em> from which Cod. B was copied must have infallibly
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contained</span></em> the twelve verses in dispute. The copyist was instructed
to leave them out,‚Äîand he obeyed: but he prudently
left a blank space <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in memoriam rei</span></span>. Never was blank
more intelligible! Never was silence more eloquent! By
this simple expedient, strange to relate, the Vatican Codex
is made to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">refute itself</span></em> even while it seems to be bearing testimony
against the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel,
by withholding them: for it forbids the inference which,
under ordinary circumstances, must have been drawn from
that omission. It does more. By <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaving room</span></em> for the
verses it omits, it brings into prominent notice at the end of
fifteen centuries and a half, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a more ancient witness than itself</span></em>.
The venerable Author of the original Codex from which
Codex B was copied, is thereby brought to view. And thus,
our supposed adversary (Codex B) proves our most useful
ally: for it procures us the testimony of an hitherto unsuspected
witness. The earlier scribe, I repeat, unmistakably
comes forward at this stage of the inquiry, to explain that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> at least is prepared to answer for the genuineness of these
Twelve concluding Verses with which the later scribe, his
copyist, from his omission of them, might unhappily be
thought to have been unacquainted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be perceived that nothing is gained by suggesting
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page088">[pg 088]</span><a name="Pg088" id="Pg088" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that the scribe of Cod. B. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> have copied from a MS. which
exhibited the same phenomenon which he has himself reproduced.
This, by shifting the question a little further
back, does but make the case against Cod. ◊ê the stronger.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in truth, after the revelation which has been already
elicited from Cod. B, the evidence of Cod. ◊ê may be very
summarily disposed of. I have already, on independent
grounds, ventured to assign to that Codex a somewhat later
date than is claimed for the Codex Vaticanus.<a id="noteref_151" name="noteref_151" href="#note_151"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">151</span></span></a> My opinion
is confirmed by observing that the Sinaitic contains no such
blank space at the end of S. Mark's Gospel as is conspicuous
in the Vatican Codex. I infer that the Sinaitic was copied
from a Codex which had been already mutilated, and reduced
to the condition of Cod. B; and that the scribe, only
because he knew not what it meant, exhibited S. Mark's
Gospel in consequence as if it really had no claim to those
twelve concluding verses which, nevertheless, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every</span></em> authority
we have hitherto met with has affirmed to belong to it
of right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whatever may be thought of the foregoing suggestion,
it is at least undeniable that Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê are at variance
on the main point. They <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contradict</span></em> one another concerning
the twelve concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel. For
while Cod. ◊ê refuses to know anything at all about those
verses, Cod. B admits that it remembers them well, by volunteering
the statement that they were found in the older
codex, of which it is in every other respect a faithful representative.
The older and the better manuscript (B), therefore,
refutes its junior (◊ê). And it will be seen that logically
this brings the inquiry to a close, as far as the evidence of
the manuscripts is concerned. We have referred to the
oldest extant copy of the Gospels in order to obtain its testimony:
and,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThough without the Twelve Verses concerning
which you are so solicitous,‚Äù</span> (it seems to say,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI yet
hesitate not to confess to you that an older copy than myself,‚Äîthe
ancient Codex from which I was copied,‚Äîactually did
contain them.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The problem may, in fact, be briefly stated as follows. Of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page089">[pg 089]</span><a name="Pg089" id="Pg089" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the four oldest Codices of the Gospels extant,‚ÄîB, ◊ê, A, C,‚Äîtwo
(B and ◊ê) are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">without</span></em> these twelve verses: two (A and C)
are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with</span></em> them. Are these twelve verses then an unauthorized
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">addition</span></em> to A and C? or are they an unwarrantable
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omission</span></em> from B and ◊ê? B itself declares plainly that from
itself they are an omission. And B is the oldest Codex of
the Gospel in existence. What candid mind will persist in
clinging to the solitary fact that from the single Codex ◊ê
these verses are away, in proof that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúS. Mark's Gospel was
at first without the verses which at present conclude it?‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let others decide, therefore, whether the present discussion
has not already reached a stage at which an unprejudiced
Arbiter might be expected to address the prosecuting
parties somewhat to the following effect:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis case must now be dismissed. The charge brought
by yourselves against these Verses was, that they are an unauthorized
addition to the second Gospel; a spurious appendix,
of which the Evangelist S. Mark can have known
nothing. But so far from substantiating this charge, you
have not adduced a single particle of evidence which renders
it even probable.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe appeal was made by yourselves to Fathers and to
MSS. It has been accepted. And with what result?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThose many Fathers whom you represented as
hostile, prove on investigation to be reducible to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>, viz. Eusebius:
and Eusebius, as we have seen, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not say</span></em> that the
verses are spurious, but on the contrary labours hard to
prove that they may very well be genuine. On the other
hand, there are earlier Fathers than Eusebius who quote
them without any signs of misgiving. In this way, the
positive evidence in their favour is carried back to the
ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span>
century.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDeclining the testimony of the Versions, you
insisted on an appeal to MSS. On the MSS., in fact, you still make
your stand,‚Äîor rather you rely on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the oldest</span></em> of them; for,
(as you are aware,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every MS. in the world except the two
oldest</span></em> are against you.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI have therefore questioned the elder of those two MSS.;
and it has volunteered the avowal that an older MS. than

itself‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Codex from which it was copied</span></em>‚Äîwas furnished
with those very Verses which you wish me to believe that
some older MS. still must needs have been without. What
else can be said, then, of your method but that it is frivolous?
and of your charge, but that it is contradicted by
the evidence to which you yourselves appeal?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBut it is illogical; that is, it is unreasonable, besides.</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúFor it is high time to point out that even if it so happened
that the oldest known MS. was observed to be without
these twelve concluding verses, it would still remain a thing
unproved (not to say highly improbable) that from the autograph
of the Evangelist himself they were also away. Supposing,
further, that no Ecclesiastical writer of the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span>
or iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century could be found who quoted them:
even so, it would not follow that there existed no such verses for a primitive
Father to quote. The earliest of the Versions might
in addition yield faltering testimony; but even so, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> would
be so rash as to raise on such a slender basis the monstrous
hypothesis, that S. Mark's Gospel when it left the hands of
its inspired Author was without the verses which at present
conclude it? How, then, would you have proposed to account
for the consistent testimony of an opposite kind yielded
by every other known document in the world?</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBut, on the other hand, what are the facts of the case?
(1) The earliest of the Fathers,‚Äî(2) the most venerable of
the Versions,‚Äî(3) the oldest MS. of which we can obtain
any tidings,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> are observed to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognize these Verses</span></em>.
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòCadit quaestio‚Äô</span> therefore. The last shadow of pretext has
vanished for maintaining with Tischendorf that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòMark the
Evangelist knew nothing of‚Äô</span> these verses:‚Äîwith Tregelles
that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòThe book of Mark himself extends no further than

I say, that this case were dismissed. But there are also costs
to be paid. Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê are convicted of being <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòtwo

with an injured reputation.‚Äù</span>

The subject which exclusively occupied our attention
throughout the foregoing chapter admits of apt and powerful
illustration. Its vast importance will be a sufficient

might have been spared, but for the plain challenge of the

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere are two remarkable readings,‚Äù</span> (says Tischendorf,

peculiarity, in which Codd.</span></em> ◊ê <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and B stand quite alone

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. Here is an extraordinary note of sympathy between
two copies of the New Testament indeed. Altogether unique
is it: and that it powerfully corroborates the general opinion
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page092">[pg 092]</span><a name="Pg092" id="Pg092" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of their high antiquity, no one will deny. But how about
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútheir <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">authority</span></em>‚Äù</span>? Does the coincidence also raise our
opinion of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the trustworthiness of the Text</span></em>, which these two
MSS. concur in exhibiting? for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is the question which
has to be considered,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> question. The ancientness of
a reading is one thing: its genuineness, (as I have explained
elsewhere,) quite another. The questions are entirely distinct.
It may even be added that while the one is really of
little moment, the latter is of all the importance in the
world. I am saying that it matters very little whether
Codd. ◊ê and B were written in the beginning of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, or in the beginning of the
v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>: whereas it matters
much, or rather it matters <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">everything</span></em>, whether they exhibit
the Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> faithfully, or occasionally with scandalous
license. How far the reading which results from the suppression
of the last two words in the phrase œÑŒø·øñœÇ ·ºÄŒ≥·Ω∑ŒøŒπœÇ œÑŒø·øñœÇ
Œø·ΩñœÉŒπŒΩ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">critically allowable</span></em> or not, I forbear to
inquire. That is not the point which we have to determine.
The one question to be considered is,‚ÄîMay it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibly</span></em> be
the true reading of the text after all? Is it any way
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credible</span></em> that S. Paul began his Epistle to the Ephesians as
follows:‚ÄîŒ†Œ±·ø¶ŒªŒøœÇ ·ºÄœÄ·ΩπœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶ ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ Œ∏ŒµŒª·ΩµŒºŒ±œÑŒøœÇ

If it be eagerly declared in reply that the thing is simply
incredible: that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ are required for the
sense; and that the commonly received reading is no doubt
the correct one: then,‚Äîthere is an end of the discussion.
Two extraordinary notes of sympathy between two Manuscripts
will have been appealed to as crucial proofs of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">trustworthiness of the Text</span></em> of those Manuscripts: (for of their
high <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Antiquity</span></em>, let me say it once more, there can be no
question whatever:) and it will have been proved in one
case,‚Äîadmitted in the other,‚Äîthat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the omission is
unwarrantable</span></em>.‚ÄîIf, however, on the contrary, it be maintained that
the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ probably had no place in the original
copy of this Epistle, but are to be regarded as an unauthorized
addition to it,‚Äîthen, (as in the case of the Twelve Verses
omitted from the end of S. Mark's Gospel, and which it was
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> pretended are an unauthorized supplement,) we demand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page093">[pg 093]</span><a name="Pg093" id="Pg093" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to be shewn the evidence on the strength of which this
opinion is maintained, in order that we may ascertain what
it is precisely worth.

Tischendorf,‚Äîthe illustrious discoverer and champion of
Codex ◊ê, and who is accustomed to appeal triumphantly to
its omission of the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the other</span></em> conclusive
proof of the trustworthiness of its text,‚Äîmay be presumed to
be the most able advocate it is likely to meet with, as well
as the man best acquainted with what is to be urged in its
support. From him, we learn that the evidence for the
omission of the words in question is as follows:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn the
beginning of the Epistle to the Ephesians we read, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòto the
saints which are at Ephesus;‚Äô</span> but Marcion (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 130-140),
did not find the words <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòat Ephesus‚Äô</span> in his copy. The same
is true of Origen (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 185-254); and Basil the Great
(who died <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 379), affirmed that those words were wanting
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">old</span></em> copies. And this omission accords very well with
the encyclical or general character of the Epistle. At the
present day, our ancient Greek MSS., and all ancient Versions,
contain the words <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòat Ephesus;‚Äô</span> yea (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">sic</span></span>), even Jerome
knew no copy with a different reading. Now, only the
Sinaitic and the Vatican correspond with the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">old</span></em> copies of
Basil, and those of Origen and Marcion.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_152" name="noteref_152" href="#note_152"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">152</span></span></a>‚ÄîThis then is

<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarcion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did not find</span></em> the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ in his copy‚Äù</span> of
S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians. Tischendorf's one pretence
for saying so is Tertullian's statement that certain
heretics, (Marcion he specifies by name,) had given to
S. Paul's <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle to the Ephesians‚Äù</span> the unauthorized title
of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the Laodiceans</span></em>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_153" name="noteref_153" href="#note_153"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">153</span></span></a> This,
(argues Tischendorf,) Marcion could not have done had he found ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ in the
first verse.<a id="noteref_154" name="noteref_154" href="#note_154"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">154</span></span></a>
But the proposed inference is clearly invalid.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page094">[pg 094]</span><a name="Pg094" id="Pg094" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
For, with what show of reason can Marcion,‚Äîwhom Tertullian
taxes with having dared <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">titulum interpolare</span></span>‚Äù</span> in the
case of S. Paul's <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle to the Ephesians,‚Äù</span>‚Äîbe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">therefore</span></em>,
assumed to have read the first verse differently from ourselves?
Rather is the directly opposite inference suggested
by the very language in which Tertullian (who
was all but the contemporary of Marcion) alludes to the
circumstance.<a id="noteref_155" name="noteref_155" href="#note_155"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">155</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Those, however, who would really understand the work
of the heretic, should turn from the African Father,‚Äî(who
after all does but say that Marcion and his crew feigned
concerning S. Paul's Epistle to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephesians</span></em>, that it was
addressed to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Laodiceans</span></em>,)‚Äîand betake themselves to the
pages of Epiphanius, who lived about a century and a half
later. This Father had for many years made Marcion's
work his special study,<a id="noteref_156" name="noteref_156" href="#note_156"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">156</span></span></a> and has elaborately described it,
as well as presented us with copious extracts from it.<a id="noteref_157" name="noteref_157" href="#note_157"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">157</span></span></a> And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page095">[pg 095]</span><a name="Pg095" id="Pg095" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the account in Epiphanius proves that Tischendorf is mistaken
in the statement which he addresses to the English
reader, (quoted above;) and that he would have better consulted
for his reputation if he had kept to the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúut videtur‚Äù</span>
with which (in his edition of 1859) he originally broached
his opinion. It proves in fact to be no matter of opinion
at all. Epiphanius states distinctly that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to the
Ephesians</span></em> was one of the ten Epistles of S. Paul which
Marcion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">retained</span></em>. In his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúApostolicon,‚Äù</span> or collection of
the (mutilated) Apostolical Epistles, the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle to the
Ephesians,‚Äù</span> (identified by the considerable quotations which
Epiphanius makes from it,<a id="noteref_158" name="noteref_158" href="#note_158"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">158</span></span></a>) stood (he says) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seventh</span></em> in
order; while the (so called) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle to the Laodiceans,‚Äù</span>‚Äîa
distinct composition therefore,‚Äîhad the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">eleventh</span></em>, that is, the
last place assigned to it.<a id="noteref_159" name="noteref_159" href="#note_159"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">159</span></span></a> That this latter Epistle contained
a corrupt exhibition of Ephes. iv. 5 is true enough. Epiphanius
records the fact in two places.<a id="noteref_160" name="noteref_160" href="#note_160"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">160</span></span></a> But then it is to
be borne in mind that he charges Marcion with having
derived that quotation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from the Apocryphal Epistle to the
Laodiceans</span></em>;<a id="noteref_161" name="noteref_161" href="#note_161"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">161</span></span></a>
instead of taking it, as he ought to have done,
from the genuine Epistle to the Ephesians. The passage,
when faithfully exhibited, (as Epiphanius points out,) by
its very form refutes the heretical tenet which the context
of Marcion's spurious epistle to the Laodiceans was intended
to establish; and which the verse in question, in its interpolated
form, might seem to favour.<a id="noteref_162" name="noteref_162" href="#note_162"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">162</span></span></a>‚ÄîI have entered into

this whole question more in detail perhaps than was necessary:
but I was determined to prove that Tischendorf's
statement that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarcion (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 130-140) did not find the
words <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòat Ephesus‚Äô</span> in his copy,‚Äù</span>‚Äîis absolutely without
foundation. It is even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">contradicted</span></em> by the known facts of
the case. I shall have something more to say about Marcion
by-and-by; who, it is quite certain, read the text of Ephes.

(2.) The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> Father who so expresses himself as to warrant
the inference that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ were absent

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page097">[pg 097]</span><a name="Pg097" id="Pg097" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ were ever away from the text. It
must be admitted as the obvious inference from what Jerome
has delivered on this subject (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infr√†</span></span>, p.
<a href="#Pg098" class="tei tei-ref">98</a> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">note</span></span>) that he, too,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) The influence which Origen's writings exercised over
his own and the immediately succeeding ages of the Church,
was prodigious. Basil, bishop of C√¶sarea in Cappadocia,
writing against the heresy of Eunomius about 150 years
later,‚Äîalthough he read ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ in his own copy of
S. Paul's Epistles,‚Äîthought fit to avail himself of Origen's
suggestion. It suited his purpose. He was proving the
eternal existence of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Son</span></span> of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>.
Even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not to know</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>
(he remarks) is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not to be</span></em>: in proof of which, he quotes
S. Paul's words in 1 Cor. i. 28:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThings <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which are not</span></em>,
hath <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> chosen.‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNay,‚Äù</span> (he proceeds,) the same S.
Paul, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin his Epistle to the Ephesians, inasmuch as he is addressing
persons who by intimate knowledge were truly joined
to Him who <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äò<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">is</span></span>,‚Äô</span> designates them specially as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòthose

and faithful in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ Jesus</span></span>.‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span> That this fancy was not
original, Basil makes no secret. He derived it, (he says,) from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthose
who were before us;‚Äù</span> a plain allusion to the writings of
Origen. But neither was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the reading</span></em> his own, either. This
is evident. He had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">found</span></em> it, he says,‚Äî(an asseveration indispensable
to the validity of his argument,)‚Äîbut only after
he had made search,<a id="noteref_164" name="noteref_164" href="#note_164"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">164</span></span></a>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the old

Origen's strange fancy must have been even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unintelligible</span></em> to
Basil when first he met with it. In plain terms, it sounds to
this day incredibly foolish,‚Äîwhen read apart from the mutilated
text which alone suggested it to Origen's fervid imagination.‚ÄîBut
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page098">[pg 098]</span><a name="Pg098" id="Pg098" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
what there is in all this to induce us to
suspect that Origen's reading was after all the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">right</span></em> one,
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ours</span></em> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wrong</span></em>, I profess myself wholly at a loss to
discover. Origen himself complains bitterly of the depraved
state of the copies in his time; and attributes it (1) to the
carelessness of the scribes: (2) to the rashness of correctors
of the text: (3) to the licentiousness of individuals, adopting
some of these corrections and rejecting others, according
to their own private caprice.<a id="noteref_166" name="noteref_166" href="#note_166"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">166</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) Jerome, a man of severer judgment in such matters
than either Origen or Basil, after rehearsing the preceding
gloss, (but only to reject it,) remarks that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcertain persons‚Äù</span>
had been <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúover-fanciful‚Äù</span> in putting it forth. He alludes
probably to Origen, whose Commentary on the Ephesians,
in three books, he expressly relates that he employed:<a id="noteref_167" name="noteref_167" href="#note_167"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">167</span></span></a> but
he does not seem to have apprehended that Origen's text
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was without the words</span></em> ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥. If he was acquainted with
Origen's text, (of which, however, his writings afford no indication,)
it is plain that he disapproved of it. Others, he says,
understand S. Paul to say not <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Saints <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which are</span></em>:‚Äù</span> but,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe

(5) The witnesses have now all been heard: and I submit
that there has been elicited from their united evidence nothing
at all calculated to shake our confidence in the universally
received reading of Ephesians i. 1. The facts of the
case are so scanty that they admit of being faithfully stated
in a single sentence. Two MSS. of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century, (exhibiting in other respects several striking notes of vicious
sympathy,) are found to conspire in omitting a clause in
Ephesians i. 1, which, (necessary as it is to the sense,) may
be inferred to have been absent from Origen's copy: and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page099">[pg 099]</span><a name="Pg099" id="Pg099" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Basil testifies that it was absent from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe old copies‚Äù</span> to
which he himself obtained access. This is really the whole
of the matter: in which it is much to be noted that Origen
does not say that he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">approved</span></em> of this reading. Still less does
Basil. They both witness to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the fact</span></em> that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥
were omitted from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> copies of the
iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century,
just as Codd. B and ◊ê witness to the same fact in the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>.
But what then? Origen is known occasionally to go out
of his way to notice readings confessedly worthless; and,
why not here? For not only is the text all but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unintelligible</span></em>
if the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ be omitted: but (what is
far more to the purpose) the direct evidence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the copies,
whether uncial or cursive,<a id="noteref_169" name="noteref_169" href="#note_169"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">169</span></span></a>‚Äîand of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the Versions,‚Äîis
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against</span></em> the omission. In the face of this overwhelming mass
of unfaltering evidence to insist that Codd. B and ◊ê must
yet be accounted right, and all the rest of Antiquity wrong,
is simply irrational. To uphold the authority, in respect of
this nonsensical reading, of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> MSS. confessedly untrustworthy
in countless other places,‚Äîagainst <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the MSS.‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em>
the Versions,‚Äîis nothing else but an act of vulgar prejudice.
I venture to declare,‚Äî(and with this I shall close
the discussion and dismiss the subject,)‚Äîthat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there does not
exist one single instance in the whole of the New Testament</span></em> of

II. Learned men have tasked their ingenuity <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to account
for</span></em> the phenomenon on which we have been bestowing so
many words. The endeavour is commendable; but I take
leave to remark in passing that if we are to set about discovering
reasons at the end of fifteen hundred years for
every corrupt reading which found its way into the sacred
text during the first three centuries subsequent to the death
of S. John, we shall have enough to do. Let any one take
up the Codex Bezae, (with which, by the way, Cod. B shews
marvellous sympathy<a id="noteref_170" name="noteref_170" href="#note_170"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">170</span></span></a>,) and explain if he can why there
is a grave omission, or else a gross interpolation, in almost
every page; and how it comes to pass that Cod. D <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúreproduces
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòtextus receptus‚Äô</span> of the Acts much in the same
way that one of the best Chaldee Targums does the Hebrew
of the Old Testament; so wide are the variations in the
diction, so constant and inveterate the practice of expounding
the narrative by means of interpolations which seldom
recommend themselves as genuine by even a semblance of
internal probability.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_171" name="noteref_171" href="#note_171"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">171</span></span></a> Our business as Critics is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
invent theories</span></em> to account for the errors of Copyists; but
rather to ascertain where they have erred, where not. What
with the inexcusable depravations of early Heretics,‚Äîthe
preposterous emendations of ancient Critics,‚Äîthe injudicious
assiduity of Harmonizers,‚Äîthe licentious caprice of individuals;‚Äîwhat
with errors resulting from the inopportune
recollection of similar or parallel places,‚Äîor from the
familiar phraseology of the Ecclesiastical Lections,‚Äîor from
the inattention of Scribes,‚Äîor from marginal glosses;‚Äîhowever
arising, endless are the corrupt readings of the
oldest MSS. in existence; and it is by no means safe to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page101">[pg 101]</span><a name="Pg101" id="Pg101" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
follow up the detection of a depravation of the text with
a theory to account for its existence. Let me be allowed to
say that such theories are seldom satisfactory. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Guesses</span></em> only

Colossians:<a id="noteref_174" name="noteref_174" href="#note_174"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">174</span></span></a> an
Epistle nevertheless so singularly like the Epistle to the Ephesians that it is scarcely
credible S. Paul would have written those two several Epistles
to two of the Churches of Asia, and yet have sent only
a duplicate of one of them, (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> to the Ephesians,) furnished
with a different address, to so large and important a place
as Laodicea, for example, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Then further, the provision
which S. Paul made at this very time for communicating with
the Churches of Asia which he did not separately address is
found to have been different. The Laodiceans were to read
in their public assembly S. Paul's <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Epistle to the
Colossians</span></span>,‚Äù</span> which the Colossians were ordered to send them. The Colossians
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page102">[pg 102]</span><a name="Pg102" id="Pg102" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in like manner were to read the Epistle,‚Äî(to whom
addressed, we know not),‚Äîwhich S. Paul describes as œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫
ŒõŒ±ŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑Œ±œÇ.<a id="noteref_175" name="noteref_175" href="#note_175"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">175</span></span></a>
If then it had been S. Paul's desire that the
Laodiceans (suppose) should read publicly in their Churches
his Epistle to the Ephesians, surely, he would have charged
the Ephesians to procure that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his Epistle to them should be
read in the Church of the Laodiceans</span></em>. Why should the
Apostle be gratuitously assumed to have simultaneously
adopted one method with the Churches of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Colosse</span></em> and Laodicea,‚Äîanother
with the Churches of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephesus</span></em> and Laodicea,‚Äîin
respect of his epistolary communications?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) But even supposing, for argument's sake, that
S. Paul <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em> send duplicate copies of his Epistle to the Ephesians
to certain of the principal Churches of Asia Minor,‚Äîwhy
should he have left the salutation <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blank</span></em>, (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcarta bianca,‚Äù</span>
as Bengel phrases it,<a id="noteref_176" name="noteref_176" href="#note_176"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">176</span></span></a>) for Tychicus to fill up when he got
into Asia Minor? And yet, by the hypothesis, nothing short
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> would account for the reading of Codd. B and ◊ê.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Let the full extent of the demand which is made on
our good nature be clearly appreciated. We are required to
believe that there was (1) A copy of what we call S. Paul's
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle to the Ephesians‚Äù</span> sent into Asia Minor by S. Paul
with a blank address; i.e. <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwith the space after œÑŒø·øñœÇ Œø·ΩîœÉŒπŒΩ
left utterly void:‚Äù</span> (2) That Tychicus neglected to fill up
that blank: and, (what is remarkable) (3) That no one was
found to fill it up for him. Next, (4) That the same copy
became the fontal source of the copy seen by Origen, and
(5) Of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúold copies‚Äù</span> seen by Basil; as well as (6) Of
Codd. B and ◊ê. And even this is not all. The same hypothesis
constrains us to suppose that, on the contrary, (7) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One
other</span></em> copy of this same <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEncyclical Epistle,‚Äù</span> filled up with
the Ephesian address, became the archetype of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every other
copy of this Epistle in the world</span></em>.... But of what nature,
(I would ask,) is the supposed necessity for building up such
a marvellous structure of hypothesis,‚Äîof which the top story
overhangs and overbalances all the rest of the edifice? The
thing which puzzles us in Codd. B and ◊ê is not that we find
the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another City</span></em> in the salutation of S. Paul's <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistle
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page103">[pg 103]</span><a name="Pg103" id="Pg103" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
to the Ephesians,‚Äù</span> but that we find the name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> city
at all; nor meet with any vacant space there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) On the other hand, supposing that S. Paul actually did
address to different Churches copies of the present Epistle,
and was scrupulous (as of course he was) to fill in the addresses
himself before the precious documents left his hands,‚Äîthen,
doubtless, each several Church would have received,
cherished, and jealously guarded its own copy. But if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> had
been the case, (or indeed if Tychicus had filled up the blanks
for the Apostle,) is it not simply incredible that we should
never have heard a word about the matter until now? unaccountable,
above all, that there should nowhere exist traces
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conflicting testimony</span></em> as to the Church to which S. Paul's
Epistle to the Ephesians was addressed? whereas <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
most ancient writers, without exception,‚Äî(Marcion himself

Dionysius Alexandrinus, Cyprian, Eusebius,)‚Äîand all copies
wheresoever found, give one unvarying, unfaltering witness.
Even in Cod. B. and Cod. ◊ê, (and this is much to be noted,)
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">superscription</span></em> of the Epistle attests that it was addressed
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto the Ephesians.‚Äù</span> Can we be warranted (I would respectfully
inquire) in inventing facts in the history of an Apostle's
practice, in order to account for what seems to be after all
only an ordinary depravation of his text?<a id="noteref_178" name="noteref_178" href="#note_178"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">178</span></span></a>

the primitive Church. It is, as far as I am aware, essentially
a modern notion. I suspect, in short, that the suggestion
before us is only another instance of the fatal misapprehension
which results from the incautious transfer of the
notions suggested by some familiar word in a living language

suggestion therefore by which it has been proposed to account
for the absence of the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ in Ephes. i. 1
is not only in itself in the highest degree improbable, and
contradicted by all the evidence to which we have access;

Marcion the heretic, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 140) is distinctly charged by

later, with having abundantly mutilated the text of Scripture,
and of S. Paul's Epistles in particular. Epiphanius
compares the writing which Marcion tampered with to a moth-eaten

name; accusing Marcion of having furnished it with a new

to page 96.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, that Marcion recognised as S. Paul's Epistle <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to
the Ephesians</span></em>‚Äù</span> that Apostolical writing which stands fifth
in our Canon, (but which stood seventh in his,) is just as
certain as that he recognised as such S. Paul's Epistles to
the Galatians, Corinthians, Romans, Thessalonians, Colossians,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is also evident that Marcion put forth as S. Paul's
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> Epistle,‚Äîof which all we know for certain is, that it
contained portions of the Epistle to the Ephesians, and purported
to be addressed by S. Paul <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto the Laodiceans.‚Äù</span> To
ascertain with greater precision the truth of this matter at the
end of upwards of seventeen centuries is perhaps impossible.
Nor is it necessary. Obvious is it to suspect that not only
did this heretical teacher at some period of his career prefix
a new heading to certain copies of the Epistle to the Ephesians,
but also that some of his followers industriously erased
from certain other copies the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ in ver. 1,‚Äîas
being <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only two words in the entire Epistle</span></em> which effectually
refuted their Master. It was not needful, (be it observed,)
to multiply copies of the Epistle for the propagation of
Marcion's deceit. Only two words had to be erased,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
very two words whose omission we are trying to account for</span></em>,‚Äîin
order to give some colour to his proposed attribution of
the Epistle, (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúquasi in isto diligentissimus explorator,‚Äù</span>)‚Äîto
the Laodiceans. One of these mutilated copies will have
fallen into the hands of Origen,‚Äîwho often complains of the
corrupt state of his text: while the critical personages for
whom Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê were transcribed will probably
have been acquainted with other such mutilated copies. Are
we not led, as it were by the hand, to take some such view
of the case? In this way we account satisfactorily, and on
grounds of historic evidence, for the omission which has
exercised the Critics so severely.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I do not lose sight of the fact that the Epistle to the
Ephesians ends without salutations, without personal notices
of any kind. But in this respect it is not peculiar.<a id="noteref_186" name="noteref_186" href="#note_186"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">186</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em>,‚Äîjoined
to a singular absence of identifying allusion,‚Äîsufficiently
explains why Marcion selected this particular Epistle
for the subject of his fraud. But, to infer from this circumstance,
in defiance of the Tradition of the Church Universal,
and in defiance of its very Title, that the Epistle is
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page108">[pg 108]</span><a name="Pg108" id="Pg108" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEncyclical,‚Äù</span> in the technical sense of that word; and to go
on to urge this characteristic as an argument in support of
the omission of the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥,‚Äîis clearly the device of
an eager Advocate; not the method of a calm and unprejudiced
Judge. True it is that S. Paul,‚Äîwho, writing to
the Corinthians from Ephesus, says <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Churches of Asia</span></em>
salute you,‚Äù</span> (1 Cor. xvi. 19,)‚Äîmay have known very well
that an Epistle of his <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto the Ephesians,‚Äù</span> would, as a matter
of course, be instantly communicated to others besides
the members of that particular Church: and in fact this
may explain why there is nothing specially <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEphesian‚Äù</span> in
the contents of the Epistle. The Apostle,‚Äî(as when he
addressed <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Churches of Galatia,‚Äù</span>)‚Äîmay have had certain
of the other neighbouring Churches in his mind while
he wrote. But all this is wholly foreign to the question

What I have been saying amounts to this: that it is absolutely
unreasonable for men to go out of their way to invent
a theory wanting every element of probability in order to
account for the omission of the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ from
S. Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians; while they have under
their eyes the express testimony of a competent witness of
the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span> century that a certain heretic,
named Marcion, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúpresumed to prefix an unauthorized title to that very Epistle,‚Äù</span>
(<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarcion ei titulum aliquando interpolare gestiit,‚Äù</span>)‚Äîwhich
title obviously <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could not stand unless those two words were first
erased from the text</span></em>. To interpolate that new title, and to
erase the two words which were plainly inconsistent with it,
were obviously correlative acts which must always have been
performed together.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But however all this may be, (as already pointed out,)
the only question to be determined by us is,‚Äîwhether it
be credible that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ are an unauthorized
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page109">[pg 109]</span><a name="Pg109" id="Pg109" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
addition; foisted into the text of Ephes. i. 1 as far back as
the Apostolic age: an interpolation which, instead of dying
out, and at last all but disappearing, has spread and established
itself, until the words are found in every copy,‚Äîare
represented in every translation,‚Äîhave been recognised in
every country,‚Äîwitnessed to by every Father,‚Äîreceived in
every age of the Church? I repeat that the one question
which has to be decided is, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how</span></em> the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ came
to be put in, or came to be left out; but simply whether, on
an impartial review of the evidence, it be reasonable (with
Tischendorf, Tregelles, Conybeare and Howson, and so many
more,) to suspect their genuineness and enclose them in
brackets? Is it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">credible</span></em> that the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ are a spurious
and unauthorized addition to the inspired autograph
of the Apostle?... We have already, as I think, obtained
a satisfactory answer to this question. It has been shewn,
as conclusively as in inquiries of this nature is possible, that
in respect of the reading of Ephesians i. 1, Codd. B and ◊ê
are even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most</span></em> conspicuously at fault.

IV. But if these two Codices are thus convicted of error
in respect of the one remaining text which their chief upholders
have selected, and to which they still make their
most confident appeal,‚Äîwhat remains, but to point out that
it is high time that men should be invited to disabuse their
minds of the extravagant opinion which they have been so
industriously taught to entertain of the value of the two
Codices in question? It has already degenerated into an
unreasoning prejudice, and threatens at last to add one more

early Latin versions, in the most ancient Syriac, and in

A writing of the second century had already witnessed to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let it be declared without offence, that there appears to
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page112">[pg 112]</span><a name="Pg112" id="Pg112" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exist in the mind of this illustrious Critic a hopeless confusion
between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">antiquity</span></em> of a Codex and the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">value</span></em> of its
readings. I venture to assert that a reading is valuable or
the contrary, exactly in proportion to the probability of its
being true or false. Interesting it is sure to be, be it what
it may, if it be found in a very ancient codex,‚Äîinteresting
and often instructive: but the editor of Scripture must
needs bring every reading, wherever found, to this test at
last:‚ÄîIs it to be thought that what I am here presented
with is what the Evangelist or the Apostle actually wrote?
If an answer in the negative be obtained to this question,
then, the fact that one, or two, or three of the early Fathers
appear to have so read the place, will not avail to impart to
the rejected reading one particle of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">value</span></em>. And yet Tischendorf
thinks it enough in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the preceding passages to assure
his reader that a given reading in Cod. ◊ê was recognised by
Origen, by Tertullian, by Jerome. To have established this
one point he evidently thinks sufficient. There is implied in
all this an utterly false major premiss: viz. That Scriptural
quotations found in the writings of Origen, of Tertullian, of
Jerome, must needs be the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ipsissima verba</span></span> of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span>. Whereas it is notorious <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the worst corruptions
to which the New Testament has ever been subjected originated within
a hundred years after it was composed: that Iren√¶us and
the whole Western, with a portion of the Syrian Church,
used far inferior manuscripts to those employed by Stunica,
or Erasmus, or Stephens, thirteen centuries later, when
moulding the Textus Receptus.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_190" name="noteref_190" href="#note_190"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">190</span></span></a> And one is astonished that a Critic of so much sagacity, (who of course
knows better,) should deliberately put forth so gross a fallacy,‚Äînot
only without a word of explanation, a word of caution,
but in such a manner as inevitably to mislead an unsuspecting
reader. Without offence to Dr. Tischendorf, I must be
allowed to declare that, in the remarks we have been considering,
he shews himself far more bent on glorifying the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCodex Sinaiticus‚Äù</span> than in establishing the Truth of the
pure Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>. He convinces me that to have found
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page113">[pg 113]</span><a name="Pg113" id="Pg113" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
an early uncial Codex, is every bit as fatal as to have <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútaken
a gift.‚Äù</span> Verily, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it doth blind the eyes of the

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And with this, I shall conclude my remarks on these two
famous Codices. I humbly record my deliberate conviction
that when the Science of Textual Criticism, which is at present
only in its infancy, comes to be better understood; (and
a careful collation of every existing Codex of the New Testament
is one indispensable preliminary to its being ever
placed on a trustworthy basis;) a very different estimate
will be formed of the importance of not a few of those readings
which at present are received with unquestioning submission,
chiefly on the authority of Codex B and Codex ◊ê.
On the other hand, it is perfectly certain that no future collations,
no future discoveries, will ever make it credible that
the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel are a spurious
supplement to the Evangelical Narrative; or that the
words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ are an unauthorized interpolation of the
inspired Text.

In the present Chapter, I propose to pass under review

1. Now of course if all that precedes were true, this department
of the Evidence would become deserving of serious
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page115">[pg 115]</span><a name="Pg115" id="Pg115" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attention. But I simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deny the fact</span></em>. I entirely deny that
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNote or Scholion‚Äù</span> which these learned persons affirm to
be of such frequent occurrence has any existence whatever,‚Äîexcept
in their own imaginations. On the other hand,
I assert that notes or scholia which state the exact reverse,
(viz. that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin the older‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe more accurate copies‚Äù</span> the
last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are contained</span></em>,) recur
even perpetually. The plain truth is this:‚ÄîThese eminent
persons have taken their information at second-hand,‚Äîpartly
from Griesbach, partly from Scholz,‚Äîwithout suspicion
and without inquiry. But then they have slightly
misrepresented Scholz; and Scholz (1830) slightly misunderstood
Griesbach; and Griesbach (1796) took liberties with
Wetstein; and Wetstein (1751) made a few serious mistakes.
The consequence might have been anticipated. The
Truth, once thrust out of sight, certain erroneous statements
have usurped its place,‚Äîwhich every succeeding Critic now
reproduces, evidently to his own entire satisfaction; though
not, it must be declared, altogether to his own credit. Let
me be allowed to explain in detail what has occurred.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Griesbach is found to have pursued the truly German
plan of setting down <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the twenty-five MSS.<a id="noteref_193" name="noteref_193" href="#note_193"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">193</span></span></a> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the
five Patristic authorities which up to his time had been
cited as bearing on the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20:
giving the former <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in numerical order</span></em>, and stating generally
concerning them that in one or other of those authorities
it would be found recorded <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat the verses in question
were anciently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wanting</span></em> in some, or in most, or in almost
all the Greek copies, or in the most accurate ones:‚Äîor else
that they were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">found</span></em> in a few, or in the more accurate
copies, or in many, or in most of them, specially in the
Palestinian Gospel.‚Äù</span> The learned writer (who had made
up his mind long before that the verses in question are to
be rejected) no doubt perceived that this would be the most
convenient way of disposing of the evidence for and against:
but one is at a loss to understand how English scholars can
have acquiesced in such a slipshod statement for well nigh
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page116">[pg 116]</span><a name="Pg116" id="Pg116" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a hundred years. A very little study of the subject would
have shewn them that Griesbach derived the first eleven of
his references from Wetstein,<a id="noteref_194" name="noteref_194" href="#note_194"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">194</span></span></a> the last fourteen
from Birch.<a id="noteref_195" name="noteref_195" href="#note_195"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">195</span></span></a>
As for Scholz, he unsuspiciously adopted Griesbach's fatal
enumeration of Codices; adding five to the number; and
only interrupting the series here and there, in order to
insert the quotations which Wetstein had already supplied
from certain of them. With Scholz, therefore, rests the
blame of everything which has been written since 1830
concerning the MS. evidence for this part of S. Mark's
Gospel; subsequent critics having been content to adopt his
statements without acknowledgment and without examination.
Unfortunately Scholz did his work (as usual) in such
a slovenly style, that besides perpetuating old mistakes he
invented new ones; which, of course, have been reproduced
by those who have simply translated or transcribed him.
And now I shall examine his note <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú(z)‚Äù</span>,<a id="noteref_196" name="noteref_196" href="#note_196"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">196</span></span></a> with which practically
all that has since been delivered on this subject
by Tischendorf, Tregelles, Davidson, and the rest, is identical.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Scholz (copying Griesbach) first states that in two
MSS. in the Vatican Library<a id="noteref_197" name="noteref_197" href="#note_197"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">197</span></span></a>
the verses in question <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúare
marked with an asterisk.‚Äù</span> The original author of this
statement was Birch, who followed it up by explaining the
fatal signification of this mark.<a id="noteref_198" name="noteref_198" href="#note_198"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">198</span></span></a> From that day to this,
the asterisks in Codd. Vatt. 756 and 757 have been religiously
reproduced by every Critic in turn; and it is universally
taken for granted that they represent two ancient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page117">[pg 117]</span><a name="Pg117" id="Pg117" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
witnesses against the genuineness of the last twelve verses of
the Gospel according to S. Mark.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet, (let me say it without offence,) a very little
attention ought to be enough to convince any one familiar
with this subject that the proposed inference is absolutely
inadmissible. For, in the first place, a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solitary</span></em> asterisk (not
at all a rare phenomenon in ancient MSS.<a id="noteref_199" name="noteref_199" href="#note_199"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">199</span></span></a>) has of necessity
no such signification. And even if it does sometimes indicate
that all the verses which follow are suspicious, (of
which, however, I have never seen an example,) it clearly
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> not have that signification here,‚Äîfor a reason which
I should have thought an intelligent boy might discover.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Well aware, however, that I should never be listened to,
with Birch and Griesbach, Scholz and Tischendorf, and indeed
every one else against me,‚ÄîI got a learned friend at
Rome to visit the Vatican Library for me, and inspect the
two Codices in question.<a id="noteref_200" name="noteref_200" href="#note_200"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">200</span></span></a>
That he would find Birch right
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in his facts</span></em>, I had no reason to doubt; but I much more
than doubted the correctness of his proposed inference from
them. I even felt convinced that the meaning and purpose
of the asterisks in question would be demonstrably different
from what Birch had imagined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Altogether unprepared was I for the result. It is found
that the learned Dane has here made one of those (venial,
but) unfortunate blunders to which every one is liable who
registers phenomena of this class in haste, and does not
methodize his memoranda until he gets home. To be brief,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there
proves to be no asterisk at all,‚Äîeither in Cod. 756,
or in Cod. 757</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the contrary. After ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ, the former Codex
has, in the text of S. Mark xvi. 9 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fol. 150 b</span></span>), a plain
cross,‚Äî(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> an asterisk, thus [symbol: x with dots in corners]
or [symbol: broken x with corner dots] or [symbol: inverse or open x], but a cross,
thus +),‚Äîthe intention of which is to refer the reader to
an annotation on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">fol. 151 b</span></span>, (marked, of course, with a cross
also,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to the effect that S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is undoubtedly
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page118">[pg 118]</span><a name="Pg118" id="Pg118" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">

The evidence, therefore, not only breaks hopelessly
down; but it is discovered that this witness has been
by accident put into the wrong box. This is, in fact, a witness
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> for the plaintiff, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">for the defendant!</span></em>‚ÄîAs for
the other Codex, it exhibits neither asterisk nor cross; but contains
the same note or scholion attesting the genuineness of the
last twelve verses of S. Mark.
</p>

I suppose I may now pass on: but I venture to point
out that unless the Witnesses which remain to be examined
are able to produce very different testimony from that borne
by the last two, the present inquiry cannot be brought to
a close too soon. (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI took thee to curse mine enemies, and,

(2.) In Codd. 20 and 300 (Scholz proceeds) we read as
follows:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúFrom here to the end forms no part of the text
in some of the copies. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">In the ancient copies, however, it all

was the first to adduce this important testimony to the genuineness of the verses
now under consideration) takes no notice of the singular circumstance
that the two MSS. he mentions have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exactly</span></em>
assimilated in ancient times to a common model; and that
they correspond one with the other so entirely<a id="noteref_203" name="noteref_203" href="#note_203"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">203</span></span></a> that the

both of them, viz. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at the close of ver.</span></em> 15, where it interrupts
the text. This was, therefore, once a scholion written in
the margin of some very ancient Codex, which has lost its
way in the process of transcription; (for there can be no
doubt that it was originally written against ver. 8.) And
let it be noted that its testimony is express; and that it
avouches for the fact that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the ancient copies</span></em>,‚Äù</span> S. Mark

(3.) Yet more important is the record contained in the
same two MSS., (of which also Scholz says nothing,) viz.
that they exhibit a text which had been <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcollated with the

attestation to the genuineness</span></em> of S. Mark xvi. 9 to 20, far outweighing
the bare statement (next to be noticed) of the undeniable
historical fact that, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in some copies</span></em>,‚Äù</span> S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ends

(5.) Scholz further states that in four, (he means three,)
other Codices very nearly the same colophon as the preceding
recurs, with an important additional clause. In Codd. 1,
199, 206, 209, (he says) is read,‚Äî

I shall have more to say about this reference to Eusebius,
and what he <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcanonized,‚Äù</span> by-and-by. But what is there in
all this, (let me in the meantime ask), to recommend the
opinion that the Gospel of S. Mark was published by its
Author in an incomplete state; or that the last twelve
verses of it are of spurious origin?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

It may sound fabulous, but it is strictly true, that every
word of this, (unsuspiciously adopted as it has been by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every

tissue of mistakes. For first,‚ÄîCod. 23 contains <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing

through haste and inadvertence, has confounded <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">his own</span></em>

tendency</span></em>: I mean, a scholion which avers that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the accurate
copies of S. Mark's Gospel contain these last twelve verses</span></em>.
(Scholz borrowed this wrong reference from Wetstein,‚Äîwho,
by an oversight, quotes Cod. 41 three times instead of twice.)‚ÄîThere
remain but Codd. 34 and 39; and in neither of
those two manuscripts, from the first page of S. Mark's Gospel
to the last, does there exist <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúscholion of Severus

written on this subject has adopted his words,‚Äîwithout
acknowledgment and without examination.... Such is the
evidence on which it is proposed to prove that S. Mark did
not write the last twelve verses of his Gospel!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(7.) Scholz proceeds to enumerate the following twenty-two
Codices:‚Äî24, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 108, 129, 137,
138, 143, 181, 186, 195, 199, 206, 209, 210, 221, 222. And
this imposing catalogue is what has misled Tischendorf,
Tregelles and the rest. They have not perceived that it is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a mere transcript of Griesbach's list</span></em>; which Scholz interrupts
only to give from Cod. 24, (imperfectly and at second-hand,)
the weighty scholion, (Wetstein had given it from Cod. 41,)
which relates, on the authority of an eye-witness, that
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 existed in the ancient Palestinian Copy.
(About that Scholion enough has been offered already.<a id="noteref_209" name="noteref_209" href="#note_209"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">209</span></span></a>)
Scholz adds that very nearly the same words are found in
374.‚ÄîWhat he says concerning 206 and 209 (and he might
have added 199,) has been explained above.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But when the twenty MSS. which remain<a id="noteref_210" name="noteref_210" href="#note_210"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">210</span></span></a> undisposed of

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page122">[pg 122]</span><a name="Pg122" id="Pg122" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
different from what is commonly supposed. One of them
(No. 38) has been cited in error: while the remaining nineteen
are nothing else but copies of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Victor of Antioch's commentary
on S. Mark</span></em>,‚Äîno less than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sixteen</span></em> of which contain
the famous attestation that in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">most of the accurate copies, and

the evidence.

(8.) So far, therefore, as <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNotes‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúScholia‚Äù</span> in MSS.

this:‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Nine Codices<a id="noteref_211" name="noteref_211" href="#note_211"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">211</span></span></a> are

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(9.) And now, shall I be thought unfair if, on a review
of the premisses, I assert that I do not see a shadow of
reason for the imposing statement which has been adopted
by Tischendorf, Tregelles, and the rest, that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthere exist
about thirty Codices which state that from the more ancient

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the exact reverse</span></em>.‚ÄîWe may now advance a step: but the

recommends Cod. L, (as it recommends three cursive Codices

with which whatever is found in Cod. B is necessarily
right. It is described as the work of an ignorant foreign
copyist, who probably wrote with several MSS. before him;

which reading to adopt and which to reject. Certain
it is that he interrupts himself, at the end of ver. 8, to

It cannot be needful that I should delay the reader with
any remarks on such a termination of the Gospel as the
foregoing. It was evidently the production of some one
who desired to remedy the conspicuous incompleteness of
his own copy of S. Mark's Gospel, but who had imbibed so
little of the spirit of the Evangelical narrative that he could
not in the least imitate the Evangelist's manner. As for the
scribe who executed Codex L, he was evidently incapable
of distinguishing the grossest fabrication from the genuine
text. The same worthless supplement is found in the margin
of the Hharklensian Syriac (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 616), and in a few other
quarters of less importance.<a id="noteref_218" name="noteref_218" href="#note_218"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">218</span></span></a>‚ÄîI pass on, with the single

present occasion, rebuked as it is for the fallacious evidence
it bears concerning the last twelve verses of the second Gospel
by all the seventeen remaining Uncials, (three of which
are from 300 to 400 years more ancient than itself;) and by
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every cursive copy of the Gospels in existence</span></em>. Quite certain
at least is it that not the faintest additional probability is
established by Cod. L that S. Mark's Gospel when it left
the hands of its inspired Author was in a mutilated condition.
The copyist shews that he was as well acquainted
as his neighbours with our actual concluding Verses: while
he betrays his own incapacity, by seeming to view with
equal favour the worthless alternative which he deliberately
transcribes as well, and to which he gives the foremost
place. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Not</span></em> S. Mark's Gospel, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but Codex L</span></em> is the sufferer

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To make this matter intelligible to the ordinary English

of what are popularly called the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAmmonian Sections‚Äù</span> and
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEusebian Canons:‚Äù</span> concerning both of which, however,
it cannot be too plainly laid down that nothing whatever
is known beyond what is discoverable from a careful
study of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCanons‚Äù</span> themselves; added
to what Eusebius has told us in that short Epistle of his
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto Carpianus,‚Äù</span>‚Äîwhich I suppose has been transcribed
and reprinted more often than any other uninspired Epistle
in the world.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius there explains that Ammonius of Alexandria
constructed with great industry and labour a kind of Evangelical
Harmony; the peculiarity of which was, that, retaining
S. Matthew's Gospel in its integrity, it exhibited
the corresponding sections of the other three Evangelists
by the side of S. Matthew's text. There resulted this inevitable
inconvenience; that the sequence of the narrative,
in the case of the three last Gospels, was interrupted
throughout; and their context hopelessly destroyed.<a id="noteref_221" name="noteref_221" href="#note_221"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">221</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiatessaron‚Äù</span> of Ammonius, (so Eusebius styles it),
has long since disappeared; but it is plain from the foregoing
account of it by a competent witness that it must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page127">[pg 127]</span><a name="Pg127" id="Pg127" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
have been a most unsatisfactory performance. It is not
easy to see how room can have been found in such a scheme
for entire chapters of S. Luke's Gospel; as well as for the
larger part of the Gospel according to S. John: in short, for
anything which was not capable of being brought into some
kind of agreement, harmony, or correspondence with something
in S. Matthew's Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How it may have fared with the other Gospels in the
work of Ammonius is not in fact known, and it is profitless
to conjecture. What we know for certain is that Eusebius,
availing himself of the hint supplied by the very imperfect
labours of his predecessor, devised an entirely different expedient,
whereby he extended to the Gospels of S. Mark,
S. Luke and S. John all the advantages, (and more than all,)
which Ammonius had made the distinctive property of the
first Gospel.<a id="noteref_222" name="noteref_222" href="#note_222"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">222</span></span></a> His plan was to retain the Four Gospels in
their integrity; and, besides enabling a reader to ascertain
at a glance the places which S. Matthew has in common
with the other three Evangelists, or with any two, or with
any one of them, (which, I suppose, was the sum of what
had been exhibited by the work of Ammonius,)‚Äîto shew
which places S. Luke has in common with S. Mark,‚Äîwhich
with S. John only; as well as which places are peculiar to
each of the four Evangelists in turn. It is abundantly clear
therefore what Eusebius means by saying that the labours
of Ammonius had <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suggested to him</span></em>‚Äù</span> his own.<a id="noteref_223" name="noteref_223" href="#note_223"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">223</span></span></a> The
sight of that Harmony of the other three Evangelists with
S. Matthew's Gospel had suggested to him the advantage
of establishing a series of parallels throughout <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all the Four
Gospels.</span></em> But then, whereas Ammonius had placed alongside
of S. Matthew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the dislocated sections themselves</span></em> of the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page128">[pg 128]</span><a name="Pg128" id="Pg128" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
other three Evangelists which are of corresponding purport,
Eusebius conceived the idea of accomplishing the same
object by means of a system of double numerical <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">references</span></em>.
He invented X Canons, or Tables: he subdivided each of the
Four Gospels into a multitude of short Sections. These he
numbered; (a fresh series of numbers appearing in each
Gospel, and extending from the beginning right on to the
end;) and immediately under every number, he inserted,
in vermillion, another numeral (I to X); whose office it was
to indicate in which of his X Canons, or Tables, the reader
would find the corresponding places in any of the other
Gospels.<a id="noteref_224" name="noteref_224" href="#note_224"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">224</span></span></a> (If the section was unique, it belonged to his last
or X<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Canon.) Thus, against S. Matthew's account
of the Title on the Cross, is written 335/I: but in the
I<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">st</span></span> Canon
(which contains the places common to all four Evangelists)
parallel with 335, is found,‚Äî214, 324, 199: and the Sections
of S. Mark, S. Luke, and S. John thereby designated,
(which are discoverable by merely casting one's eye down
the margin of each of those several Gospels in turn, until
the required number has been reached,) will be found to
contain the parallel record in the other three Gospels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
All this is so purely elementary, that its very introduction
in this place calls for apology. The extraordinary
method of the opposite party constrains me however to
establish thus clearly the true relation in which the familiar
labours of Eusebius stand to the unknown work of
Ammonius.

seeing that they must needs be perfectly well aware that
they have no means whatever of knowing (except from the
precarious evidence of Caten√¶) what Ammonius thought
about any single verse in any of the four Gospels? At every
stage of this discussion, I am constrained to ask myself,‚ÄîDo

really suppose that their statements will <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> be examined?
their references <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> verified? or is it thought
that they enjoy a monopoly of the learning (such as it is)
which enables a man to form an opinion in this department
of sacred Science? For,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Where</span></em> then and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what</span></em> are those <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections of

appeal? It is even notorious that when they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">say</span></em> the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections
of Ammonius,‚Äù</span> what they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mean</span></em> are the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius</span></em>.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîBut, (2dly.) Where is the proof,‚Äîwhere is even
the probability,‚Äîthat these two are identical? The Critics
cannot require to be reminded by me that we are absolutely
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page130">[pg 130]</span><a name="Pg130" id="Pg130" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
without proof that so much as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> of the Sections of Ammonius
corresponded with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> of those of Eusebius; and yet,
(3dly.) Who sees not that unless the Sections of Ammonius
and those of Eusebius can be proved to have corresponded
throughout, the name of Ammonius has no business whatever
to be introduced into such a discussion as the present?
They must at least be told that in the entire absence of
proof of any kind,‚Äî(and certainly nothing that Eusebius
says warrants any such inference,<a id="noteref_226" name="noteref_226" href="#note_226"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">226</span></span></a>)‚Äîto reason from the
one to the other as if they were identical, is what no sincere
inquirer after Truth is permitted to do.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is time, however, that I should plainly declare that it
happens to be no matter of opinion at all whether the lost
Sections of Ammonius were identical with those of Eusebius
or not. It is demonstrable that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> have been so;
and the proof is supplied by the Sections themselves. It is
discovered, by a careful inspection of them, that they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">imply</span></em>
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">presuppose the Ten Canons</span></em>; being in many places even
meaningless,‚Äînugatory, in fact, (I do not of course say
that they are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">practically</span></em> without <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">use</span></em>,)‚Äîexcept
on the theory that those Canons were already in existence.<a id="noteref_227" name="noteref_227" href="#note_227"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">227</span></span></a> Now the
Canons are confessedly the invention of Eusebius. He distinctly
claims them.<a id="noteref_228" name="noteref_228" href="#note_228"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">228</span></span></a> Thus much then concerning the supposed
testimony of Ammonius. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nil</span></em>.‚ÄîAnd now for
what is alleged concerning the evidence of Eusebius.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The starting-point of this discussion, (as I began by remarking),
is the following memorandum found in certain
ancient MSS.:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThus far did Eusebius canonize;‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_229" name="noteref_229" href="#note_229"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">229</span></span></a> which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page131">[pg 131]</span><a name="Pg131" id="Pg131" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
means either: (1) That his Canons recognise no section of
S. Mark's Gospel subsequent to ¬ß 233, (which number is
commonly set over against ver. 8:) or else, (which comes to
the same thing,)‚Äî(2) That no sections of the same Gospel,
after ¬ß 233, are referred to any of his X Canons.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On this slender foundation has been raised the following
precarious superstructure. It is assumed,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) That the Section of S. Mark's Gospel which Eusebius
numbers <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú233,‚Äù</span> and which begins at our ver. 8, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot have
extended beyond</span></em> ver. 8;‚Äîwhereas it may have extended, and
probably did extend, down to the end of ver. 11.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2dly.) That because no notice is taken in the Eusebian
Canons of any sectional <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">number</span></em> in S. Mark's Gospel subsequent
to ¬ß 233, no <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Section</span></em> (with, or without, such a subsequent
number) can have existed:‚Äîwhereas there may
have existed one or more subsequent Sections all duly numbered.<a id="noteref_230" name="noteref_230" href="#note_230"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">230</span></span></a>
This notwithstanding, Eusebius, (according to the
memorandum found in certain ancient MSS.), may have
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">canonized</span></em> no further than ¬ß 233.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am not disposed, however, to contest the point as far as
Eusebius is concerned. I have only said so much in order
to shew how unsatisfactory is the argumentation on the
other side. Let it be assumed, for argument sake, that the
statement <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEusebius canonized no farther than ver. 8‚Äù</span> is
equivalent to this,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius numbered no Sections after
ver.</span></em> 8;‚Äù</span> (and more it cannot mean:)‚ÄîWhat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>? I am at
a loss to see what it is that the Critics propose to themselves
by insisting on the circumstance. For we knew before,‚Äîit
was in fact Eusebius himself who told us,‚Äîthat Copies
of the Gospel ending abruptly at ver. 8, were anciently of
frequent occurrence. Nay, we heard the same Eusebius remark
that one way of shelving a certain awkward problem
would be, to plead that the subsequent portion of
S. Mark's Gospel is frequently wanting. What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> have we
learned when we have ascertained that the same Eusebius
allowed no place to that subsequent portion in his Canons?
The new fact, (supposing it to be a fact,) is but the correlative
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page132">[pg 132]</span><a name="Pg132" id="Pg132" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the old one; and since it was Eusebius who was the
voucher for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, what additional probability do we establish
that the inspired autograph of S. Mark ended abruptly
at ver. 8, by discovering that Eusebius is consistent with
himself, and omits to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcanonize‚Äù</span> (or even to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsectionize‚Äù</span>)
what he had already hypothetically hinted might as well be
left out altogether? (See above, pp. <a href="#Pg044" class="tei tei-ref">44-6</a>.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So that really I am at a loss to see that one atom of progress
is made in this discussion by the further discovery
that, (in a work written about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 373,)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Epiphanius</span></span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
states casually that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe four Gospels contain 1162
sections.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_231" name="noteref_231" href="#note_231"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">231</span></span></a>
From this it is argued<a id="noteref_232" name="noteref_232" href="#note_232"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">232</span></span></a>
that since 355 of these are commonly assigned to S. Matthew, 342 to S. Luke, and
232 to S. John, there do but remain for S. Mark 233; and
the 233rd section of S. Mark's Gospel confessedly begins at
ch. xvi. 8.‚ÄîThe probability may be thought to be thereby
slightly increased that the sectional numbers of Eusebius
extended no further than ver. 8: but‚ÄîHas it been rendered
one atom more probable that the inspired Evangelist himself
ended his Gospel abruptly at the 8th verse? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> fact‚Äî(the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> thing which our opponents have to establish)‚Äîremains
exactly where it was; entirely unproved, and in the
highest degree improbable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To conclude, therefore. When I read as follows in the
pages of Tischendorf:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThese verses are not recognised by
the Sections of Ammonius, nor by the Canons of Eusebius:
Epiphanius and C√¶sarius bear witness to the fact;‚Äù</span>‚ÄîI am
constrained to remark that the illustrious Critic has drawn
upon his imagination for three of his statements, and that
the fourth is of no manner of importance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) About the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections of Ammonius,‚Äù</span> he really knows
no more than about the lost Books of Livy. He is, therefore,
without excuse for adducing them in the way of evidence.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page133">[pg 133]</span><a name="Pg133" id="Pg133" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) That Epiphanius bears no witness whatever either
as to the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections of Ammonius‚Äù</span> or to <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCanons of Eusebius,‚Äù</span>
Tischendorf is perfectly well aware. So is my reader.

to which Tischendorf refers. Even the approximate
date of this performance, however, has never been

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A distinct class of objections remains to be considered.
An argument much relied on by those who deny or doubt
the genuineness of this portion of S. Mark's Gospel, is derived
from considerations of internal evidence. In the judgment
of a recent Editor of the New Testament,‚ÄîThese
twelve verses <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbear traces of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another hand</span></em> from that which
has shaped the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">diction</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">construction</span></em> of the rest of the
Gospel.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_240" name="noteref_240" href="#note_240"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">240</span></span></a> They are therefore
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúan addition to the narrative,‚Äù</span>‚Äîof which <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe internal evidence will be
found to preponderate vastly against the authorship of Mark.‚Äù</span>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúA
difference,‚Äù</span> (says Dr. Tregelles,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhas been remarked, and
truly remarked, between <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the phraseology</span></em> of this section and
the rest of this Gospel.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîAccording to Dr. Davidson,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">phraseology and style</span></em> of the section are unfavourable
to its authenticity.‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe characteristic peculiarities which
pervade Mark's Gospel do not appear in it; but, on the contrary,
terms and expressions,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúphrases and words, are introduced
which Mark never uses; or terms for which he
employs others.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_241" name="noteref_241" href="#note_241"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">241</span></span></a>‚ÄîSo Meyer,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWith ver. 9, we suddenly
come upon an excerpting process totally different from the
previous mode of narration. The passage contains none of
Mark's peculiarities (no Œµ·ΩêŒ∏·Ω≥œâœÇ, no œÄ·Ω±ŒªŒπŒΩ, &amp;c, but the baldness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page137">[pg 137]</span><a name="Pg137" id="Pg137" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and lack of clearness which mark a compiler;) while in
single expressions, it is altogether contrary to Mark's manner.‚Äù</span>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThere
is‚Äù</span> (says Professor Norton) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa difference so
great between the use of language in this passage, and its
use in the undisputed portion of Mark's Gospel, as to furnish
strong reasons for believing the passage not genuine.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîNo
one, however, has expressed himself more strongly on this subject
than Tischendorf. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSingula‚Äù</span> (he says) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmultifariam a
Marci ratione abhorrent.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_242" name="noteref_242" href="#note_242"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">242</span></span></a>... Here, then, is something
very like a consensus of hostile opinion: although the terms of the
indictment are somewhat vague. Difference of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiction and
Construction,‚Äù</span>‚Äîdifference of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPhraseology and Style,‚Äù</span>‚Äîdifference
of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTerms and Expressions,‚Äù</span>‚Äîdifference of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWords
and Phrases;‚Äù</span>‚Äîthe absence of S. Mark's <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcharacteristic
peculiarities.‚Äù</span> I suppose, however, that all may be brought
under two heads,‚Äî(I.) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Style</span></span>, and (II.)
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phraseology</span></span>: meaning
by <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúStyle‚Äù</span> whatever belongs to the Evangelist's manner;
and by <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPhraseology‚Äù</span> whatever relates to the words
and expressions he has employed. It remains, therefore,
that we now examine the proofs by which it is proposed to
substantiate these confident assertions, and ascertain exactly
what they are worth by constant appeals to the Gospel.
Throughout this inquiry, we have to do not with Opinion
but with Fact. The unsupported dicta of Critics, however
distinguished, are entitled to no manner of attention.

however reproduce them under protest, and with apology.
The names of Tischendorf and Tregelles, Meyer and Davidson,
command attention. It seems to be thought incredible
that they can <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">entirely</span></em> in the wrong. They impose

(to my surprise and regret) two suggestions:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The one,‚ÄîThat this entire section of the second
Gospel may possibly have been written long after the rest;
and that therefore its verbal peculiarities need not perplex
or trouble us. It was, I suppose, (according to this learned
and pious writer,) a kind of after-thought, or supplement,
or Appendix to S. Mark's Gospel. In this way I have seen
the last Chapter of S. John once and again accounted for.‚ÄîTo
which, it ought to be a sufficient answer to point out
that there is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no appearance whatever</span></em> of any such interval
having been interposed between S. Mark xvi. 8 and 9: that
it is highly improbable that any such interval occurred:
and that until the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúverbal peculiarities‚Äù</span> have been ascertained
to exist, it is, to say the least, a gratuitous exercise of
the inventive faculty to discover reasons for their existence.
Whether there be not something radically unsound and
wrong in all such conjectures about <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúafter-thoughts,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsupplements,‚Äù</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúappendices,‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsecond editions‚Äù</span> when the
everlasting Gospel of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus Christ</span></span> is the thing spoken
of,‚Äîa confusing of things heavenly with things earthly which
must make the Angels weep,‚ÄîI forbear to press on the present
occasion. It had better perhaps be discussed at another
opportunity. But œÜ·Ω∑ŒªŒøŒπ ·ºÑŒΩŒ¥œÅŒµœÇ<a id="noteref_244" name="noteref_244" href="#note_244"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">244</span></span></a> will forgive my freedom in
having already made my personal sentiment on the subject
sufficiently plain.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) His other suggestion is,‚ÄîThat this portion may not
have been penned by S. Mark himself after all. By which
he clearly means no more than this,‚Äîthat as we are content
not to know <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who</span></em> wrote the conclusion of the Books of
Deuteronomy and Joshua, so, if needful, we may well be
content not to know who wrote the end of the Gospel of
S. Mark.‚ÄîIn reply to which, I have but to say, that after
cause has been shewn why we should indeed believe that not
S. Mark but some one else wrote the end of S. Mark's Gospel,
we shall be perfectly willing to acquiesce in the new
fact:‚Äîbut <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not till then</span></em>.

from the familiar premisses; (for the self-same statements

to have ever thought of calling the premisses themselves in
question: examining the statements one by one: contesting
the ground inch by inch: refusing absolutely to submit to
any dictation whatever in this behalf: insisting on bringing
the whole matter to the test of severe inquiry, and making
every detail the subject of strict judicial investigation. This
is what I propose to do in the course of the present Chapter.
I altogether deny the validity of the inference which has
been drawn from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe style,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe phraseology,‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe diction‚Äù</span>
of the present section of the Gospel. But I do more.
I entirely deny the accuracy of almost <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every individual statement</span></em>
from which the unfavourable induction is made, and the
hostile inference drawn. Even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> will not nearly satisfy
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page140">[pg 140]</span><a name="Pg140" id="Pg140" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
me. I insist that one only result can attend the exact
analysis of this portion of the Gospel into its elements;
namely, a profound conviction that S. Mark is most certainly
its Author.

3. Let me however distinctly declare beforehand that
remarks on <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe style‚Äù</span> of an Evangelist are singularly
apt to be fallacious, especially when (as here) it is proposed
to apply them to a very limited portion of the sacred narrative.
Altogether to be mistrusted moreover are they, when
(as on the present occasion) it is proposed to make them
the ground for possibly rejecting such a portion of Scripture
as spurious. It becomes a fatal objection to such reasoning
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the style</span></em> may indeed be exceedingly diverse, and yet
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Author</span></em> be confessedly one and the same. How exceedingly
dissimilar in style are the Revelation of S. John and
the Gospel of S. John! Moreover, practically, the promised
remarks on <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äústyle,‚Äù</span> when the Authorship of some portion
of Scripture is to be discussed, are commonly observed to
degenerate at once into what is really quite a different thing.
Single words, perhaps some short phrase, is appealed to,
which (it is said) does not recur in any part of the same
book; and thence it is argued that the Author can no longer
be the same. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAccording to this argument, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the recurrence
of the same words</span></em> constitutes identity of style; the want
of such recurrence implies difference of style;‚Äîdifference
of style in such a sense as compels us to infer diversity of
authorship. Each writer is supposed to have at his disposal
a limited number of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòformul√¶‚Äô</span> within the range of which
he must work. He must in each chapter employ these
formul√¶, and these only. He must be content with one
small portion of his mother-tongue, and not dare to venture
across the limits of that portion,‚Äîon pain of losing his
identity.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_247" name="noteref_247" href="#note_247"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">247</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page141">[pg 141]</span><a name="Pg141" id="Pg141" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
such a method of judging about the Authorship of any
twelve verses of Scripture which can be named, scarcely
requires illustration. The attentive reader of S. Matthew's

ix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> chapters is perhaps only once

i<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">st</span></span> chapter may be
thought unlike anything else in S. Matthew. S. Luke's five
opening verses are unique, both in respect of manner and
of matter. S. John also in his five opening verses seems to
me to have adopted a method which is not recognisable
anywhere else in his writings; <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúrising strangely by degrees,‚Äù</span>
(as Bp. Pearson expresses it,<a id="noteref_249" name="noteref_249" href="#note_249"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">249</span></span></a>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmaking the last
word of the former sentence the first of that which
followeth.‚Äù</span>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> knoweth that he saith true,‚Äù</span> is the language
of the same Evangelist concerning himself in chap. xix. 35.
But, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">we</span></em> know that his testimony is true,‚Äù</span> is his phrase in
chap. xxi. 24. Twice, and twice only throughout his Gospel,
(viz. in chap. xix. 35: xx. 31), is he observed to address his
readers, and on both occasions in the same words: (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ye</span></em> may believe.‚Äù</span>) But what of all this? Is it to be supposed
that S. Matthew, S. Luke, S. John are not the authors
of those several places? From facts like these no inference
whatever is to be drawn as to the genuineness or the spuriousness
of a writing. It is quite to mistake the Critic's
vocation to imagine that he is qualified, or called upon, to
pass any judgment of the sort.

5. I have not said all this, of course, as declining the proposed
investigation. I approach it on the contrary right
willingly, being confident that it can be attended by only
one result. With what is true, endless are the harmonies

1. We are assured that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúinstead of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">graphic, detailed</span></em>

brief notices from larger accounts, and loosely linked

what is the force of the adverse criticism, as directed against
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuineness</span></em> of the passage now under consideration.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But in truth, (when divested of what is merely a gratuitous
assumption,) the preceding account of the matter
is probably not far from the correct one. Of S. Mark's
practice of making <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">extracts</span></em>,‚Äù</span> I know nothing: nor Dr.
Davidson either. That there existed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlarger accounts‚Äù</span>
which would have been available for such a purpose, (except
the Gospel according to S. Matthew,) there is neither a particle
of evidence, nor a shadow of probability. On the other
hand, that, notwithstanding the abundant oral information
to which confessedly he had access, S. Mark has been divinely
guided in this place to handle, in the briefest manner,
some of the chiefest things which took place after our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Resurrection,‚Äîis simply undeniable. And without at all
admitting that the style of the Evangelist is in consequence
either <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúabrupt‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsententious,‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_252" name="noteref_252" href="#note_252"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">252</span></span></a> I yet recognise the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page143">[pg 143]</span><a name="Pg143" id="Pg143" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
inevitable consequence of relating many dissimilar things
within very narrow limits; namely, that the transition from
one to the other forces itself on the attention. What wonder
that the same phenomenon should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> be discoverable in
other parts of the Gospel where the Evangelist is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> observed
to be doing the same thing?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. But wherever in his Gospel S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> doing the same
thing, he is observed to adopt the style and manner which
Dr. Davidson is pleased to call <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsententious‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúabrupt.‚Äù</span>
Take twelve verses in his first chapter, as an example.
Between S. Mark xvi. 9-20 and S. Mark i. 9-20, I profess
myself unable to discern any real difference of style. I proceed

S. Mark's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> chapter, which are to be compared with the
twelve verses already under discussion, from his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last</span></em>; and

(ver. 9.) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnd it came to pass in those days, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>
came from Nazareth of Galilee, and was baptized of John

water, He saw the heavens opened, and the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span> like
a dove descending upon Him: (11.) and there came a
voice from heaven saying, Thou art My beloved <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Son</span></span>, in

the Gospel. (16.) Now, as He walked by the sea

said unto them, Come ye after Me, and I will make you
to become fishers of men. (18.) And straightway they
forsook their net's, and followed Him. (19.) And when
He had gone a little farther thence, He saw James the
son of Zebedee, and John his brother, who also were in

4. The candid reader must needs admit that precisely the
self-same manner is recognisable in this first chapter of
S. Mark's Gospel which is asserted to be peculiar to the last.
Note, that from our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Baptism (which occupies
the first three verses) the Evangelist passes to His Temptation,
which is dismissed in two. Six months elapse. The
commencement of the Ministry is dismissed in the next two
verses. The last five describe the call of four of the Apostles,‚Äîwithout
any distinct allusion to the miracle which
was the occasion of it.... How was it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possible</span></em> that when
incidents considerable as these had to be condensed within
the narrow compass of twelve verses, the same <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgraphic,
detailed description‚Äù</span> could reappear which renders S. Mark's
description of the miracle performed in the country of the
Gadarenes (for example) so very interesting; where a single
incident is spread over twenty verses, although the action
did not perhaps occupy an hour? I rejoice to observe that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abrupt transitions</span></em> of this section‚Äù</span> (ver. 1-13) have
also been noticed by Dean Alford: who very justly accounts
for the phenomenon by pointing out that here <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMark
appears as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an abridger of previously well-known
facts</span></em>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_253" name="noteref_253" href="#note_253"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">253</span></span></a> But then, I want to know what there is in this to induce us to
suspect <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the genuineness</span></em> of either the beginning or the end of
S. Mark's Gospel?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. For it is a mistake to speak as if <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgraphic, detailed
description‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> characterise the second Gospel.
S. Mark is quite as remarkable for his practice of occasionally
exhibiting a considerable transaction in a highly
abridged form. The opening of his Gospel is singularly
concise, and altogether <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sudden</span></em>. His account of John's preaching
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page145">[pg 145]</span><a name="Pg145" id="Pg145" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
(i. 1-8) is the shortest of all. Very concise is his account
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Baptism (ver. 9-11). The brevity
of his description of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Temptation is even
extraordinary (ver. 12, 13.)‚ÄîI pass on; premising that I shall
have occasion to remind the reader by-and-by of certain
peculiarities in these same Twelve Verses, which seem to
have been hitherto generally overlooked.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. Nothing more true, therefore, than Dr. Tregelles' admission
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat arguments on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">style</span></em> are often very fallacious, and
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by themselves</span></em> they prove very little. But‚Äù</span> (he proceeds)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhen there does exist external evidence; and when internal
proofs as to style, manner, verbal expression, and connection,
are in accordance with such independent grounds of
forming a judgment; then, these internal considerations possess
very great weight.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I have already shewn that there exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> such external
evidence as Dr. Tregelles supposes. And in the absence of
it, I am bold to assert that since nothing in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúStyle‚Äù</span> or
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPhraseology‚Äù</span> of these verses ever aroused suspicion in
times past, we have rather to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on our guard</span></em> against suffering
our judgment to be warped by arguments drawn from
such precarious considerations now. As for determining
from such data the authorship of an isolated passage; asserting
or denying its genuineness for no other reason but
because it contains certain words and expressions which do
or do not occur elsewhere in the Gospel of which it forms
part;‚Äîlet me again declare plainly that the proceeding is
in the highest degree uncritical. We are not competent
judges of what words an Evangelist was likely on any given
occasion to employ. We have no positive knowledge of the
circumstances under which any part of any one of the four
Gospels was written; nor the influences which determined
an Evangelist's choice of certain expressions in preference to
others. We are learners,‚Äîwe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be only learners here.
But having said all this, I proceed (as already declared)
without reluctance or misgiving to investigate the several
charges which have been brought against this section of the
Gospel; charges derived from its <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Phraseology</span></span>; and which
will be found to be nothing else but repeated assertions that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page146">[pg 146]</span><a name="Pg146" id="Pg146" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a certain Word or Phrase,‚Äî(there are about twenty-four
such words and phrases in all,<a id="noteref_254" name="noteref_254" href="#note_254"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">254</span></span></a>)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúoccurs nowhere in the
Gospel of Mark;‚Äù</span> with probably the alarming asseveration
that it is <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúabhorrent to Mark's manner.‚Äù</span> ... The result of
the inquiry which follows will perhaps be not exactly what
is commonly imagined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The first difficulty of this class is very fairly stated by
one whose name I cannot write without a pang,‚Äîthe late
Dean Alford:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(I.) The expression œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ, for the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfirst day of
the week‚Äù</span> (in ver. 9) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis remarkable‚Äù</span> (he says) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúas occurring
so soon after‚Äù</span> Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ (a precisely equivalent
expression) in ver. 2.‚ÄîYes, it is remarkable.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Scarcely more remarkable, perhaps, than that S. Luke
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the course of one and the same chapter</span></em> should four times
designate the Sabbath œÑ·Ω∏ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ, and twice œÑ·Ω∞ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ±:
again, twice, œÑ·Ω∏ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ,‚Äîtwice, ·º° ·º°Œº·Ω≥œÅŒ± œÑŒø·ø¶ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ,‚Äîand
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page147">[pg 147]</span><a name="Pg147" id="Pg147" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

Or again, that S. Matthew should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in one and the same chapter</span></em> five
times call the Sabbath, œÑ·Ω∞ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ≤œÑŒ±, and three times, œÑ·Ωπ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ.<a id="noteref_256" name="noteref_256" href="#note_256"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">256</span></span></a> Attentive readers
will have observed that the Evangelists seem to have been
fond in this way of varying their phrase; suddenly introducing
a new expression for something which they had designated
differently just before. Often, I doubt not, this is
done with the profoundest purpose, and sometimes even with
manifest design; but the phenomenon, however we may
explain it, still remains. Thus, S. Matthew, (in his account
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Temptation,‚Äîchap. iv.,) has ·ΩÅ Œ¥Œπ·Ω±Œ≤ŒøŒªŒøœÇ in
ver. 1, and ·ΩÅ œÄŒµŒπœÅ·Ω±Œ∂œâŒΩ in ver. 3, for him whom our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>
calls Œ£Œ±œÑŒ±ŒΩ·æ∂œÇ in ver. 10.‚ÄîS. Mark, in chap. v. 2, has œÑ·Ω∞
ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµ·øñŒ±,‚Äîbut in ver. 5, œÑ·Ω∞ ŒºŒΩ·ΩµŒºŒ±œÑŒ±.‚ÄîS. Luke, in xxiv. 1, has
œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒΩ·øÜŒºŒ±; but in the next verse, œÑ·Ω∏ ŒºŒΩŒ∑ŒºŒµ·øóŒøŒΩ.‚Äî·ºòœÄ·Ω∑ with an
accusative twice in S. Matth. xxv. 21, 23, is twice exchanged
for ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ with a genitive in the same two verses: and ·ºîœÅŒπœÜŒøœã
(in ver. 32) is exchanged for ·ºêœÅ·Ω∑œÜŒπŒ± in ver. 33.‚ÄîInstead of
·ºÑœÅœáœâŒΩ œÑœÇ œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ≥œâŒ≥·øÜœÇ (in S. Luke viii. 41) we read, in ver. 49,
·ºÄœÅœáŒπœÉœÖŒΩ·Ω±Œ≥œâŒ≥ŒøœÇ: and for Œø·º± ·ºÄœÄ·ΩπœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøŒπ (in ix. 10) we find
Œø·º± Œ¥·ΩΩŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ± in ver. 12.‚ÄîŒü·ΩñœÇ in S. Luke xxii. 50 is exchanged for
·Ω†œÑ·Ω∑ŒøŒΩ in the next verse.‚ÄîIn like manner, those whom S. Luke
calls Œø·º± ŒΩŒµ·ΩΩœÑŒµœÅŒøŒπ in Acts v. 6, he calls ŒΩŒµŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∑œÉŒ∫ŒøŒπ in ver. 10....
All such matters strike me as highly interesting, but not in
the least as suspicious. It surprises me a little, of course,
that S. Mark should present me with œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ (in
ver. 9) instead of the phrase Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ, which he had
employed just above (in ver. 2.) But it does not surprise me
much,‚Äîwhen I observe that Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occurs only once
in each of the Four Gospels</span></em>.<a id="noteref_257" name="noteref_257" href="#note_257"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">257</span></span></a> Whether surprised much or
little, however,‚ÄîAm I constrained in consequence, (with
Tischendorf and the rest,) to regard this expression (œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑
œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ) as a note of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">spuriousness</span></em>? That is the only thing
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page148">[pg 148]</span><a name="Pg148" id="Pg148" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
I have to consider. Am I, with Dr. Davidson, to reason as
follows:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúœÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑, Mark would scarcely have used. It should
have been Œº·Ω∑Œ±, &amp;c. as is proved by Mark xvi. 2, &amp;c. The
expression could scarcely have proceeded from a Jew. It
betrays a Gentile author.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_258" name="noteref_258" href="#note_258"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">258</span></span></a> Am I to reason thus?... I propose
to answer this question somewhat in detail.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) That among the Greek-speaking Jews of Palestine,
in the days of the Gospel, ·º° Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ was the established
method of indicating <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe first day of the week,‚Äù</span> is
plain, not only from the fact that the day of the Resurrection
is so designated by each of the Four Evangelists in
turn;<a id="noteref_259" name="noteref_259" href="#note_259"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">259</span></span></a>
(S. John has the expression twice;) but also from
S. Paul's use of the phrase in 1 Cor. xvi. 2. It proves,
indeed, to have been the ordinary Hellenistic way of exhibiting
the vernacular idiom of Palestine.<a id="noteref_260" name="noteref_260" href="#note_260"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">260</span></span></a> The cardinal

establishes this concerning œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ: a reference to the
six places cited just now in earlier note establishes it concerning
œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒ±. To see how indifferently the two forms (œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ
and œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒ±) were employed, one has but to notice

proof, (if proof were needed,) how abhorrent to a Latin

Latin versions of S. Matthew xxviii. 1; where ·ΩÑœàŒµ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ,

(3.) The reader will now be prepared for the suggestion,
that when S. Mark, (who is traditionally related to have
written his Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at Rome</span></em>,<a id="noteref_264" name="noteref_264" href="#note_264"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">264</span></span></a>) varies, in ver. 9, the phrase

he had employed in ver. 2, he does so for an excellent and
indeed for an obvious reason. In ver. 2, he had conformed
to the prevailing usage of Palestine, and followed the example
set him by S. Matthew (xxviii. 1) in adopting the enigmatical
expression, ·º° Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ. That this would be
idiomatically represented <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in Latin</span></em> by the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúprima
sabbati,‚Äù</span> we have already seen. In ver. 9, therefore, he is
solicitous to record the fact of the Resurrection afresh; and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> time, his phrase is observed to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Greek equivalent
for the Latin </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúprima sabbati;‚Äù</span></em> viz. œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ. How
strictly equivalent the two modes of expression were felt to
be by those who were best qualified to judge, is singularly
illustrated by the fact that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Syriac</span></em> rendering of both
places is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">identical</span></em>.

(4.) But I take leave to point out that this substituted
phrase, instead of being a suspicious circumstance, is on the
contrary a striking note of genuineness. For do we not
recognise here, in the last chapter of the Gospel, the very

S. Mark,‚Äîwho, alone of the four Evangelists,

was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the father of Alexander and Rufus</span></em>,‚Äù</span> evidently for the

himself to the precedent set him by S. Matthew and the
familiar usage of Palestine; and having written œÑ·øÜœÇ ŒºŒπ·æ∂œÇ

(viz. œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ,) in ver. 9.‚ÄîThis, therefore, I repeat,
so far from being a circumstance <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unfavourable</span></em> to its authenticity,‚Äù</span>
(by which, I presume, the learned writer means
its <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">genuineness</span></em>), is rather corroborative of the Church's constant
belief that the present section of S. Mark's Gospel is,
equally with the rest of it, the production of S. Mark. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNot

(II.) Less excusable is the coarseness of critical perception
betrayed by the next remark. It has been pointed out
as a suspicious circumstance that in ver. 9, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe phrase

(1.) The phrase <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> have been taken from S. Luke;

(2.) More important is it to expose the shallowness and
futility of the entire objection.‚ÄîMary Magdalene <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhad

Well but,‚ÄîWhat <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em>? After twice (ch. xiv. 54, 66) using
the word Œ±·ΩêŒª·Ωµ without any <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúappendix,‚Äù</span> in the very next
chapter (xv. 16) S. Mark adds, ·ΩÖ ·ºêœÉœÑŒπ œÄœÅŒ±ŒπœÑ·ΩΩœÅŒπŒøŒΩ.‚ÄîThe
beloved Disciple having mentioned himself without any
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúappendix‚Äù</span> in S. John xx. 7, mentions himself with a very
elaborate <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúappendix‚Äù</span> in ver. 20. But what of it?‚ÄîThe

are either uninteresting or unimportant. That

that a different author is recognisable, is abhorrent
to the spirit of intelligent Criticism.

(3.) But in the case before us, the hostile suggestion is peculiarly
infelicitous. There is even inexpressible tenderness
and beauty, the deepest Gospel significancy, in the reservation
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page153">[pg 153]</span><a name="Pg153" id="Pg153" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of the clause <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúout of whom He had cast seven devils,‚Äù</span>

<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúappendix,‚Äù</span> which would have been meaningless before, is
introduced in connexion with Mary Magdalene's august

the risen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>. Jerome (I rejoice to find) has been

(III.) Take the next example.‚ÄîThe very form of the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing of the sort, I answer. S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em> has ·ºêŒ∫Œ≤·Ω±ŒªŒªŒµŒπŒΩ
·ºêŒ∫,<a id="noteref_274" name="noteref_274" href="#note_274"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">274</span></span></a> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> sees not that such Criticism is simply nugatory?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(IV.) We are next favoured with the notable piece of
information that the word œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúnever used by
S. Mark, is three times contained in this passage;‚Äù</span> (viz. in
verses 10, 12 and 15.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Yes. The uncompounded verb, never used <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">elsewhere</span></em>
by S. Mark, is found here three times. But what then?
The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">compounds</span></em> of œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ are common enough in his
Gospel. Thus, short as his Gospel is, he alone has Œµ·º∞œÉ-œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ,
·ºêŒ∫-œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, œÉœÖŒº-œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, œÄŒ±œÅŒ±-œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oftener than all the other three Evangelists put together</span></em>,‚Äîviz.
twenty-four times against their nineteen: while the compound
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page154">[pg 154]</span><a name="Pg154" id="Pg154" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
œÄœÅŒøœÉœÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to his Gospel</span></em>.‚ÄîI am therefore
inclined to suggest that the presence of the verb œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ
in these Twelve suspected Verses, instead of being an
additional element of suspicion, is rather a circumstance
slightly corroborative of their genuineness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) But suppose that the facts had been different. The
phenomenon appealed to is of even perpetual recurrence,
and may on no account be represented as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicious</span></em>. Thus,
œÄŒ±œÅŒøœÖœÉ·Ω∑Œ±, a word used only by S. Matthew among the Evangelists,
is by him used four times; yet are all those four
instances found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in one and the same chapter</span></em>. S. Luke alone
has œáŒ±œÅ·Ω∑Œ∂ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, and he has it three times: but all three
cases are met with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in one and the same chapter</span></em>. S. John
alone has Œª·ΩªœÄŒ∑, and he has it four times: but all the four
instances occur <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in one and the same chapter</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) Such instances might be multiplied to almost any
extent. Out of the fifteen occasions when S. Matthew uses
the word œÑ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ, no less than fourteen occur in one
chapter. The nine occasions when S. Luke uses the word
ŒºŒΩ·æ∂ all occur in one chapter. S. John uses the verb ·ºÄŒΩŒπœÉœÑ·Ω±ŒΩŒ±Œπ
transitively only four times: but all four instances
of it are found in one chapter.‚ÄîNow, these three words
(be it observed) are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to the Gospels</span></em> in which they
severally occur.

(4.) I shall of course be reminded that œÑ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒΩœÑŒøŒΩ and ŒºŒΩ·æ∂

it will be found that œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñœÉŒ± in ver. 10,‚ÄîœÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøŒº·Ω≥ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page155">[pg 155]</span><a name="Pg155" id="Pg155" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ver. 12,‚ÄîœÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏·Ω≥ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ in ver. 15,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúadmit of no substitute
in the places where they severally occur;‚Äù</span> and therefore,
since the verb itself is one of S. Mark's favourite verbs,
not only are these three places above suspicion, but they
may be fairly adduced as indications that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the same</span></em> hand was
at work here which wrote all the rest of his Gospel.<a id="noteref_275" name="noteref_275" href="#note_275"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">275</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(V.) Then further,‚Äîthe phrase œÑŒø·øñœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ·æΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒº·Ω≥ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ
(in ver. 10) is noted as suspicious. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThough found in
the Acts (xx. 18) it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never occurs in the Gospels</span></em>: nor does the
word ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒ±·Ω∑ in this passage.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) The phrase Œø·º± ŒºŒµœÑ·æΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ≥ŒµŒΩ·ΩπŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ occurs nowhere
in the Acts or in the Gospels, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">except here</span></em>. But,‚ÄîWhy
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should</span></em> it appear elsewhere? or rather,‚ÄîHow <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> it? Now,
if the expression be (as it is) an ordinary, easy, and obvious
one,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wanted</span></em> in this place, where it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> met with;
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> met with elsewhere, simply because elsewhere it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em>
wanted;‚Äîsurely it is unworthy of any one calling himself
a Critic to pretend that there attaches to it the faintest
shadow of suspicion!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) The essence of the phrase is clearly the expression
Œø·º± ŒºŒµœÑ·æΩ Œ±œÖœÑŒø·ø¶. (The aorist participle of Œ≥·Ω∑ŒΩŒøŒºŒ±Œπ, is added of
necessity to mark the persons spoken of. In no other, (certainly
in no simpler, more obvious, or more precise) way
could the followers of the risen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> have been designated
at such a time. For had He not just now <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúovercome
the sharpness of Death‚Äù</span>?) But this expression, which occurs
four times in S. Matthew and four times in S. Luke, occurs
also four times in S. Mark: viz. in chap. i. 36; ii. 25; v. 40,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and here</span></em>. This, therefore, is a slightly corroborative
circumstance,‚Äînot at all a ground of suspicion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) But it seems to be implied that S. Mark, because he
mentions œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑ·Ω±œÇ often elsewhere in his Gospel, ought
to have mentioned them here.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(a) I answer:‚ÄîHe does not mention œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑ·Ω±œÇ nearly
so often as S. Matthew; while S. John notices them twice
as often as he does.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(b) Suppose, however, that he elsewhere mentioned them
five hundred times, because he had occasion five hundred
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page156">[pg 156]</span><a name="Pg156" id="Pg156" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
times to speak of them;‚Äîwhat reason would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> be for his
mentioning them here, where he is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> speaking of them?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) It must be evident to any one reading the Gospel
with attention that besides Œø·º± ŒºŒ±Œ∏Œ∑œÑŒ±·Ω∑,‚Äî(by which expression
S. Mark always designates <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Twelve Apostles</span></em>,)‚Äîthere
was a considerable company of believers assembled together
throughout the first Easter Day.<a id="noteref_276" name="noteref_276" href="#note_276"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">276</span></span></a> S. Luke notices this
circumstance when he relates how the Women, on their
return from the Sepulchre, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútold all these things unto the
Eleven, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to all the rest</span></em>,‚Äù</span> (xxiv. 9): and again when he
describes how Cleopas and his companion (Œ¥·ΩªŒø ·ºêŒæ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ as
S. Luke and S. Mark call them) on their return to Jerusalem,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfound the Eleven gathered together, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and them that
were with them</span></em>‚Äù</span> (xxiv. 33.) But this was at least as well
known to S. Mark as it was to S. Luke. Instead, therefore,
of regarding the designation <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them that had been with Him</span></em>‚Äù</span>
with suspicion,‚Äîare we not rather to recognise in it one
token more that the narrative in which it occurs is unmistakably
genuine? What else is this but one of those delicate
discriminating touches which indicate the hand of a great
Master; one of those evidences of minute accuracy which
stamp on a narrative the impress of unquestionable Truth?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(VI.) We are next assured by our Critic that Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis
unknown to Mark;‚Äù</span> but it occurs twice in this section, (viz.
in ver. 11 and ver. 14.) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Another</span></em> suspicious circumstance!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) A strange way (as before) of stating an ordinary
fact, certainly! What else is it but to assume the thing
which has to be proved? If the learned writer had said
instead, that the verb Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, here twice employed by
S. Mark, occurs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere else</span></em> in his Gospel,‚Äîhe would
have acted more loyally, not to say more fairly by the
record: but then he would have been stating a strictly
ordinary phenomenon,‚Äîof no significancy, or relevancy to
the matter in hand. He is probably aware that œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤Œ±·Ω∑ŒΩŒµŒπŒΩ
in like manner is to be found in two consecutive verses of
S. Matthew's Gospel; œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œø·ΩªŒµŒπŒΩ, twice in the course of one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page157">[pg 157]</span><a name="Pg157" id="Pg157" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
verse: neither word being used on any other occasion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">either
by S. Matthew, or by any other Evangelist</span></em>. The same thing
precisely is to be said of ·ºÄŒΩŒ±Œ∂Œ∑œÑŒµ·øñŒΩ and ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒ±œÄŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ¥·ΩπŒΩŒ±Œπ, of
·ºÄŒΩœÑŒπœÄŒ±œÅ·Ω≥œÅœáŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, and Œ¥ŒπŒ±œÑ·Ω∑Œ∏ŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, in S. Luke: of ·ºÄŒΩŒπœÉœÑ·Ω±ŒΩŒ±Œπ
and Œ∂œâŒΩŒΩ·ΩªŒΩŒ±Œπ in S. John. But who ever dreamed of insinuating
that the circumstance is suspicious?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) As for Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ, we should have reminded our Critic
that this verb, which is used seven times by S. John, and
four times by S. Matthew, is used only three times by
S. Luke, and only twice by S. Mark. And we should have respectfully
inquired,‚ÄîWhat possible suspicion does Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ
throw upon the last twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) None whatever, would have been the reply. But in
the meantime Dr. Davidson hints that the verb <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">ought</span></em> to have
been employed by S. Mark in chap. ii. 14.<a id="noteref_277" name="noteref_277" href="#note_277"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">277</span></span></a>‚ÄîIt is,
I presume, sufficient to point out that S. Matthew, at all events, was
not of Dr. Davidson's opinion:<a id="noteref_278" name="noteref_278" href="#note_278"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">278</span></span></a> and
I respectfully submit that the Evangelist, inasmuch as he happens to be here
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">writing about himself</span></em>, must be allowed, just for once, to be
the better judge.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) In the meantime,‚ÄîIs it not perceived that Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ
is the very word specially required in these two places,‚Äîthough
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere else in S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>?<a id="noteref_279" name="noteref_279" href="#note_279"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">279</span></span></a> The occasion is
one,‚Äîviz. the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbeholding‚Äù</span> of the person of the risen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>. Does not even natural piety suggest that the
uniqueness of such a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúspectacle‚Äù</span> as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> might well set an Evangelist
on casting about for a word of somewhat less ordinary occurrence?
The occasion cries aloud for this very verb Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ;
and I can hardly conceive a more apt illustration of a
darkened eye,‚Äîa spiritual faculty perverted from its lawful
purpose,‚Äîthan that which only discovers <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa stumbling-block
and occasion of falling‚Äù</span> in expressions like the present which
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúshould have been only for their wealth,‚Äù</span> being so manifestly
designed for their edification.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page158">[pg 158]</span><a name="Pg158" id="Pg158" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(VII.) But,‚Äî(it is urged by a Critic of a very different
stamp,)‚Äî·ºêŒ∏Œµ·Ω±Œ∏Œ∑ ·ΩëœÄ·æΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·øÜœÇ (ver. 11) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis a construction only
found here in the New Testament.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Very likely; but what then? The learned writer has
evidently overlooked the fact that the passive Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ occurs
but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three times</span></em> in the New Testament <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in
all</span></em>.<a id="noteref_280" name="noteref_280" href="#note_280"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">280</span></span></a> S.
Matthew, on the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> occasions when he employs the word, connects it with
a dative.<a id="noteref_281" name="noteref_281" href="#note_281"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">281</span></span></a> What is there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicious</span></em> in the circumstance that
Œ∏Œµ·æ∂œÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ ·ΩëœÄ·Ωπ should be the construction preferred by S. Mark?
The phenomenon is not nearly so remarkable as that S. Luke,
on one solitary occasion, exhibits the phrase Œº·Ω¥ œÜŒøŒ≤Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œµ
·ºÄœÄ·Ωπ,<a id="noteref_282" name="noteref_282" href="#note_282"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">282</span></span></a>‚Äîinstead of making the verb govern
the accusative, as he does three times <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the very next verse</span></em>; and,
indeed, eleven times in the course of his Gospel. To be sure, S. Luke in
this instance is but copying S. Matthew, who <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> has Œº·Ω¥
œÜŒøŒ≤Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œµ ·ºÄœÄ·Ωπ once;<a id="noteref_283" name="noteref_283" href="#note_283"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">283</span></span></a> and seven times makes the
verb govern an accusative. This, nevertheless, constitutes no reason
whatever for suspecting the genuineness either of S. Matth.
x. 28 or of S. Luke xii. 4.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) In like manner, the phrase ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤·ΩµŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ œÜ·ΩπŒ≤ŒøŒΩ Œº·Ω≥Œ≥Œ±ŒΩ
will be found to occur once, and once <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>, in S. Mark,‚Äîonce,
and once only, in S. Luke;<a id="noteref_284" name="noteref_284" href="#note_284"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">284</span></span></a>
although S. Mark and S. Luke use the verb œÜŒøŒ≤Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ upwards of forty times. Such
facts are interesting. They may prove important. But no one
who is ever so little conversant with such inquiries will pretend
that they are in the least degree <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicious</span></em>.‚ÄîI pass on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(VIII.) It is next noted as a suspicious circumstance that
·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ occurs in ver. 11 and in ver. 16; but nowhere else
in the Gospels,‚Äîexcept in S. Luke xxiv. 11, 14.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But really, such a remark is wholly without force, as an
argument against the genuineness of the passage in which
the word is found: for,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Where else in the course of this Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ
have occurred? Now, unless some reason can be shewn why
the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">should</span></em>, or at least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">might</span></em> have been employed
elsewhere, to remark upon its introduction in this place, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where it
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page159">[pg 159]</span><a name="Pg159" id="Pg159" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
could scarcely be dispensed with</span></em>, as a ground of suspicion, is
simply irrational. It might just as well be held to be a suspicious
circumstance, in respect of verses 3 and 4, that the
verb ·ºÄœÄŒøŒ∫œÖŒª·Ω∑Œ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ occurs there, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and there only</span></em>, in this Gospel.
Nothing whatever follows from the circumstance. It is, in
fact, a point scarcely deserving of attention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) To be sure, if the case of a verb exclusively used by
the two Evangelists, S. Mark and S. Luke, were an unique,
or even an exceedingly rare phenomenon, it might have been
held to be a somewhat suspicious circumstance that the phenomenon
presented itself in the present section. But nothing
of the sort is the fact. There are no fewer than forty-five
verbs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclusively used by S. Mark and S. Luke</span></em>. And why
should not ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ be, (as it is,) one of them?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) Note, next, that this word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is used twice</span></em>, and in the
course of his last chapter too, also <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by S. Luke</span></em>. Nowhere
else does it occur in the Gospels. It is at least as strange
that the word ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ should be found twice in the last
chapter of the Gospel according to S. Luke, as in the last
chapter of the Gospel according to S. Mark. And if no
shadow of suspicion is supposed to result from this circumstance
in the case of the third Evangelist, why should it in
the case of the second?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) But, lastly, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the noun</span></em> ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∑Œ± (which occurs in S. Mark
xvi. 14) occurs in two other places of the same Gospel. And
this word (which S. Matthew uses twice,) is employed by
none of the other Evangelists.‚ÄîWhat need to add another
word? Do not many of these supposed suspicious circumstances,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em>
one for example,‚Äîprove rather, on closer inspection,
to be confirmatory facts?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(IX.) We are next assured that ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑŒ±·ø¶œÑŒ± (ver. 12) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is
not found in Mark</span></em>, though many opportunities occurred for
using it.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) I suppose that what this learned writer means, is this;
that if S. Mark had coveted an opportunity for introducing
the phrase ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑŒ±·ø¶œÑŒ± earlier in his Gospel, he might have
found one. (More than this cannot be meant: for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere</span></em>
before does S. Mark employ <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any other phrase</span></em> to express
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúafter these things,‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúafter this,‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúafterwards.‚Äù</span>)
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page160">[pg 160]</span><a name="Pg160" id="Pg160" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what is the obvious inference from the facts of the case,
as stated by the learned Critic, except that the blessed Evangelist
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must be presumed to have been unconscious of any desire
to introduce the expression under consideration on any other occasion
except the present</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Then, further, it is worth observing that while the
phrase ŒºŒµœÑ·Ω∞ œÑŒ±·ø¶œÑŒ± occurs five times in S. Luke's Gospel, it is
found only twice in the Acts; while S. Matthew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never employs
it at all</span></em>. Why, then,‚ÄîI would respectfully inquire‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>
need S. Mark introduce the phrase <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more than once</span></em>? Why,
especially, is his solitary use of the expression to be represented
as a suspicious circumstance; and even perverted into
an article of indictment against the genuineness of the last
twelve verses of his Gospel? <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúWould any one argue that
S. Luke was not the author of the Acts, because the author
of the Acts has employed this phrase only twice,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòoften as
he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> have used it?‚Äô</span> (Meyer's phrase here.<a id="noteref_285" name="noteref_285" href="#note_285"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">285</span></span></a>)‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(X.) Another objection awaits us,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú·ºõœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ also is unknown
to Mark,‚Äù</span> says Dr. Davidson;‚Äîwhich only means
that the word occurs in chap. xvi. 12, but not elsewhere in
his Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It so happens, however, that ·ºïœÑŒµœÅŒøœÇ also occurs once only
in the Gospel of S. John. Does it therefore throw suspicion
on S. John xix. 37?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XI.) The same thing is said of ·ΩïœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ (in ver. 14) viz.
that it <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúoccurs nowhere‚Äù</span> in the second Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But why not state the case thus?‚Äî·ΩùœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ, a word which
is twice employed by S. Luke, occurs only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em> in S. Mark
and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">once</span></em> in S. John.‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> would be the true way of
stating the facts of the case. But it would be attended with this
inconvenient result,‚Äîthat it would make it plain that the
word in question has no kind of bearing on the matter in
hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XII.) The same thing he says of Œ≤Œª·Ω±œÄœÑŒµŒπŒΩ (in ver. 18).
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But what is the fact? The word occurs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only twice in the
Gospels</span></em>,‚Äîviz. in S. Mark xvi. 18 and S. Luke iv. 35. It is
one of the eighty-four words which are peculiar to S. Mark
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page161">[pg 161]</span><a name="Pg161" id="Pg161" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis unknown to Mark;‚Äù</span> which (as we begin to be
aware) is the learned gentleman's way of stating that it is
only found in chap. xvi. 20.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Alford insist that it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> occurs
in S. Mark i. 28. I respectfully differ from them in opinion:
but when it has been pointed out that the word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is only used
besides in S. Luke</span></em> ix. 6, what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be said of such Criticism but
that it is simply frivolous?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XIV. and XV.) Yet again:‚ÄîœÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œµ·øñŒΩ and Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒπŒø·ø¶ŒΩ are
also said by the same learned Critic to be <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúunknown to
Mark.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
S. Mark certainly uses these two words only once,‚Äîviz. in
the last verse of the present Chapter: but what there is suspicious
in this circumstance, I am at a loss even to divine.
He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> not have used them oftener; and since one hundred
and fifty-six words are peculiar to his Gospel, why should
not œÉœÖŒΩŒµœÅŒ≥Œµ·øñŒΩ and Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œ±ŒπŒø·ø¶ŒΩ be two of them?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XVI.) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúŒ†·æ∂œÉŒ± Œ∫œÑ·Ω∑œÉŒπœÇ is Pauline,‚Äù</span> proceeds Dr. Davidson,
(referring to a famous expression which is found in ver. 15.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) All very oracular,‚Äîto be sure: but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> œÄ·æ∂œÉŒ± Œ∫œÑ·Ω∑œÉŒπœÇ
should be thought <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPauline‚Äù</span> rather than <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPetrine,‚Äù</span> I really,
once more, cannot discover; seeing that S. Peter has the expression
as well as S. Paul.<a id="noteref_286" name="noteref_286" href="#note_286"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">286</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) In this place, however, the phrase is œÄ·æ∂œÉŒ± ·º° Œ∫œÑ·Ω∑œÉŒπœÇ.
But even this expression is no more to be called <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPauline‚Äù</span>
than <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarcine;‚Äù</span> seeing that as S. Mark uses it once and
once only, so does S. Paul use it once and once only, viz.
in Rom. viii. 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) In the meantime, how does it come to pass that the
learned Critic has overlooked the significant fact that the
word Œ∫œÑ·Ω∑œÉŒπœÇ occurs besides in S. Mark x. 6 and xiii. 19; and
that it is a word which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark alone of the Evangelists uses</span></em>?
Its occurrence, therefore, in this place is a circumstance the
very reverse of suspicious.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) But lastly, inasmuch as the opening words of our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page162">[pg 162]</span><a name="Pg162" id="Pg162" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Ministerial Commission to the Apostles are

inasmuch, too, as S. Paul in his Epistle to the Colossians
(i. 23) almost reproduces those very words; speaking of the

conjecture that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a direct reference</span></em> to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> place in S. Mark's
Gospel is contained in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> place of S. Paul's Epistle? that
the inspired Apostle <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbeholding the universal tendency of
Christianity already realized,‚Äù</span> announces (and from imperial
Rome!) the fulfilment of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> commands in his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
own words as recorded by the Evangelist S. Mark?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I desire to be understood to deliver this only as a conjecture.
But seeing that S. Mark's Gospel is commonly thought
to have been written at Rome, and under the eye of S. Peter;
and that S. Peter (and therefore S. Mark) must have been at
Rome before S. Paul visited that city in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 61;‚Äîseeing,
too, that it was in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 61-2 (as Wordsworth and Alford are
agreed) that S. Paul wrote his Epistle to the Colossians, and
wrote it from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Rome</span></em>;‚ÄîI really can discover nothing unreasonable
in the speculation. If, however, it be well founded,‚Äî(and
it is impossible to deny that the coincidence of expression
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">may</span></em> be such as I have suggested,)‚Äîthen, what an
august corroboration would <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> be of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last Twelve
Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark!‚Äù</span> ... If, indeed,
the great Apostle on reaching Rome inspected S. Mark's
Gospel for the first time, with what awe will he have recognised
in his own recent experience the fulfilment of his
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> great announcement concerning the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsigns which
should follow them that believe!‚Äù</span> Had he not himself <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcast
out devils?‚Äù</span>‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúspoken with tongues more than they all?‚Äù</span>‚Äîand
at Melita, not only <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúshaken off the serpent into the fire
and felt no harm,‚Äù</span> but also <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlaid hands on the sick‚Äù</span> father
of Publius, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúand he had recovered?‚Äù</span> ... To return, however,
to matters of fact; with an apology (if it be thought necessary)
for what immediately goes before.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XVII.) Next,‚Äî·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ·ΩÄŒΩ·ΩπŒºŒ±œÑŒπ ŒºŒøœÖ (ver. 17) is noticed as
another suspicious peculiarity. The phrase is supposed to occur
only in this place of S. Mark's Gospel; the Evangelist elsewhere
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page163">[pg 163]</span><a name="Pg163" id="Pg163" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
employing the preposition ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑:‚Äî(viz. in ix. 37: ix. 39:
xiii. 6.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Now really, if it were so, the reasoning would be nugatory.
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Luke</span></em> also once, and once only, has ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ·ΩÄŒΩ·ΩπŒºŒ±œÑ·Ω∑
œÉŒøœÖ: his usage elsewhere being, (like S. Mark's) to use ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑.
Nay, in two consecutive verses of ch. ix, ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ œÑ·ø∑ ·ΩÄŒΩ·ΩπŒºŒ±œÑ·Ω∑ ŒºŒøœÖ‚ÄîœÉŒøœÖ
is read: and yet, in the very next chapter, his Gospel
exhibits an unique instance of the usage of ·ºêŒΩ. Was it
ever thought that suspicion is thereby cast on S. Luke x. 17?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) But, in fact, the objection is an oversight of the
learned (and generally accurate) objector. The phrase recurs
in S. Mark ix. 38,‚Äîas the text of that place has been revised
by Tischendorf, by Tregelles and by himself. This is therefore
a slightly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corroborative</span></em>, not a suspicious circumstance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XVIII. and XIX.) We are further assured that œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ
(in ver. 17) and ·ºêœÄŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ (in ver. 20) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúare both
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign to the diction of Mark</span></em>.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) But what can the learned author of this statement
possibly mean? He is not speaking of the uncompounded
verb ·ºÄŒ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ, of course; for S. Mark employs it at least
twenty times. He cannot be speaking of the compounded
verb; for œÉœÖŒΩŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ occurs in S. Mark v. 37. He cannot
mean that œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ, because the Evangelist uses
it only once, is suspicious; for that would be to cast a slur
on S. Luke i. 3. He cannot mean generally that verbs compounded
with prepositions are <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúforeign to the diction of
Mark;‚Äù</span> for there are no less than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">forty-two</span></em> such verbs
which are even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to S. Mark's short Gospel</span></em>,‚Äîagainst
thirty which are peculiar to S. Matthew, and seventeen
which are peculiar to S. John. He cannot mean that verbs
compounded with œÄŒ±œÅ·Ω± and ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ have a suspicious look; for
at least <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thirty-three</span></em> such compounds, (besides the two before
us,) occur in his sixteen chapters.<a id="noteref_287" name="noteref_287" href="#note_287"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">287</span></span></a> What, then, I must
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page164">[pg 164]</span><a name="Pg164" id="Pg164" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
really ask, can the learned Critic possibly mean?‚ÄîI respectfully
pause for an answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) In the meantime, I claim that as far as such evidence
goes,‚Äî(and it certainly goes a very little way, yet, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as far as
it goes</span></em>,)‚Äîit is a note of S. Mark's authorship, that within the
compass of the last twelve verses of his Gospel these two
compounded verbs should be met with.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XX.) Dr. Davidson points out, as another suspicious circumstance,
that (in ver. 18) the phrase œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±œÇ ·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒπŒ∏·Ω≥ŒΩŒ±Œπ
·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ œÑŒπŒΩŒ± occurs; <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúinstead of œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±œÇ ·ºêœÄŒπœÑŒπŒ∏·Ω≥ŒΩŒ±Œπ œÑŒπŒΩŒπ.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) But on the contrary, the phrase <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is in Mark's manner</span></em>,‚Äù</span>
says Dean Alford: the plain fact being that it occurs
no less than three times in his Gospel,‚Äîviz. in chap. viii.
25: x. 16: xvi. 18. (The other idiom, he has four times.<a id="noteref_288" name="noteref_288" href="#note_288"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">288</span></span></a>)
Behold, then, one and the same phrase is appealed to as
a note of genuineness <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">and</span></em> as an indication of spurious origin.
What <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">can</span></em> be the value of such Criticism as this?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Indeed, the phrase before us supplies no unapt illustration
of the precariousness of the style of remark which
is just now engaging our attention. Within the space of
three verses, S. Mark has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">both</span></em> expressions,‚Äîviz. ·ºêœÄŒπŒ∏Œµ·Ω∂œÇ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ
œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±œÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∑ (viii. 23) and also ·ºêœÄ·Ω≥Œ∏Œ∑Œ∫Œµ œÑ·Ω∞œÇ œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±œÇ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ (ver. 25.) S. Matthew has the
latter phrase once; the former, twice.<a id="noteref_289" name="noteref_289" href="#note_289"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">289</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Who</span></em> will not admit that all this (so-called) Criticism
is the veriest trifling; and that to pretend to argue
about the genuineness of a passage of Scripture from such
evidence as the present is an act of rashness bordering on
folly?... The reader is referred to what was offered above
on Art. VII.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XXI. and XXII.) Again: the words Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œø·ΩñŒΩ‚Äî·ΩÅ Œö·ΩªœÅŒπŒøœÇ
(ver. 19 and ver. 20) are also declared to be <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign to the
diction of Mark</span></em>.‚Äù</span> I ask leave to examine these two charges
separately.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page165">[pg 165]</span><a name="Pg165" id="Pg165" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Œº·Ω≤ŒΩ Œø·ΩñŒΩ occurs only once in S. Mark's Gospel, truly:
but then <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it occurs only once in S. Luke</span></em> (iii. 18);‚Äîonly twice
in S. John (xix. 24: xx. 30):‚Äîin S. Matthew, never at all.
What imaginable plea can be made out of such evidence
as this, for or against the genuineness of the last Twelve
Verses of S. Mark's Gospel?‚ÄîOnce more, I pause for an
answer.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) As for ·ΩÅ Œö·ΩªœÅŒπŒøœÇ being <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">foreign to the diction of Mark</span></em>
in speaking of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>,‚Äù</span>‚ÄîI really do not know what
the learned Critic can possibly mean; except that he finds

By no means, (I shall perhaps be told:) a reason is assignable
for the use of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> expression in chap. i. 1. And so,
I venture to reply, there is a fully sufficient reason assignable

(3.) By S. Matthew, by S. Mark, by S. John, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>

(4.) S. John <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three times in the first verse of his first Chapter</span></em>

(XXIII.) Another complaint:‚Äî·ºÄŒΩŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÜŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ, which is

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) True. S. Mark has no fewer than seventy-four verbs
which <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúoccur nowhere else in the Gospels:‚Äù</span> and this happens
to be one of them? What possible inconvenience can
be supposed to follow from that circumstance?

(2.) But the remark is unreasonable. ·ºàŒΩŒ±ŒªŒ∑œÜŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ and

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is high time to conclude this discussion.‚ÄîMuch has
been said about two other minute points:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XXIV.) It is declared that ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis nowhere found
absolutely used by S. Mark:‚Äù</span> (the same thing may be said
of S. Matthew and of S. Luke also:) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbut always emphatically:
whereas in verses 10 and 11, it is absolutely used.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_294" name="noteref_294" href="#note_294"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">294</span></span></a>
Another writer says,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe use of ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ in verses 10, 11,
and 13 (twice) in a manner synonymous with ·ΩÅ Œ¥·Ω≥, is

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Slightly peculiar it is, no doubt, but not very, that
an Evangelist who employs an ordinary word in the ordinary
way about thirty times in all, should use it <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù</span>
in two consecutive verses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) But really, until the Critics can agree among themselves
as to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> are precisely the offending instances,‚Äî(for
it is evidently a moot point whether ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·øñŒΩŒøœÇ be emphatic
in ver. 13, or not,)‚Äîwe may be excused from a prolonged
discussion of such a question. I shall recur to the
subject in the consideration of the next Article (XXV.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XXV.) So again, it may be freely admitted that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin the

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) Unless we can be shewn at least two or three other
sections of S. Mark's Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">resembling the present</span></em>,‚Äî(I mean,
passages in which S. Mark summarizes many disconnected
incidents, as he does here,)‚Äîis it not plain that such an
objection is wholly without point?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Two instances are cited. In the latter, (ver. 14),
Lachmann and Tregelles read ·ΩîœÉœÑŒµœÅŒøŒΩ Œ¥·Ω≥: and the reading
is not impossible. So that the complaint is really reduced
to this,‚ÄîThat in ver. 10 the Evangelist begins
·ºòŒ∫Œµ·Ω∂ŒΩŒ∑ œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñœÉŒ±, instead of saying ŒöŒ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑ŒΩŒ∑ œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñœÉŒ±.
And (it is implied) there is something so abhorrent
to probability in this, as slightly to strengthen the suspicion
that the entire context is not the work of the Evangelist.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) Now, suppose we had S. Mark back among us: and
suppose that he, on being shewn this objection, were to be
heard delivering himself somewhat to the following effect:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAye.
But men may not find fault with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> turn of phrase.
I derived it from Simon Peter's lips. I have always suspected
that it was a kind of echo, so to say, of what he
and <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòthe other Disciple‚Äô</span> had many a time rehearsed in the
hearing of the wondering Church concerning the Magdalene
on the morning of the Resurrection.‚Äù</span> And then we
should have remembered the familiar place in the fourth
Gospel:‚Äî

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) For after all, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> question to be asked is,‚ÄîWill
any one pretend that such a circumstance as this is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspicious</span></em>?
Unless <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> be asserted, I see not what is gained by
raking together,‚Äî(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as one easily might do in any section of any
of the Gospels</span></em>,)‚Äîevery minute peculiarity of form or expression
which can possibly be found within the space of these
twelve verses. It is an evidence of nothing so much as
an incorrigible coarseness of critical fibre, that every slight
variety of manner or language should be thus pounced upon
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page168">[pg 168]</span><a name="Pg168" id="Pg168" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
and represented as a note of spuriousness,‚Äîin the face of
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) the unfaltering tradition of the Church universal that
the document has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> been hitherto suspected: and
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) the known proclivity of all writers, as free moral and
intellectual agents, sometimes to deviate from their else
invariable practice.‚ÄîMay I not here close the discussion?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There will perhaps be some to remark, that however successfully
the foregoing objections may seem to have been
severally disposed of, yet that the combined force of such
a multitude of slightly suspicious circumstances must be not
only appreciable, but even remain an inconvenient, not to
say a formidable fact. Let me point out that the supposed
remark is nothing else but a fallacy; which is detected the
instant it is steadily looked at.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For if there really had remained after the discussion of
each of the foregoing XXV Articles, a slight residuum of
suspiciousness, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">then</span></em> of course the aggregate of so many fractions
would have amounted to something in the end.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But since it has been proved that there is absolutely
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nothing at all</span></em> suspicious in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> of the alleged circumstances
which have been hitherto examined, the case becomes altogether
different. The sum of ten thousand nothings is still
nothing.<a id="noteref_296" name="noteref_296" href="#note_296"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">296</span></span></a> This may be conveniently illustrated by an appeal
to the only charge which remains to be examined.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(XXVI. and XXVII.) The absence from these twelve
verses of the adverbs Œµ·ΩêŒ∏·Ω≥œâœÇ and œÄ·Ω±ŒªŒπŒΩ,‚Äî(both of them
favourite words with the second Evangelist,)‚Äîhas been
pointed out as one more suspicious circumstance. Let us
take the words singly:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The adverb Œµ·ΩêŒ∏·Ω≥œâœÇ (or Œµ·ΩêŒ∏·ΩªœÇ) is indeed of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em>
frequent occurrence in S. Mark's Gospel. And yet its absence from
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page169">[pg 169]</span><a name="Pg169" id="Pg169" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
chap. xvi is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proved</span></em> to be in no degree a suspicious circumstance,
from the discovery that though it occurs as many as

(1.) Now,‚ÄîHow can it possibly be more suspicious that
œÄ·Ω±ŒªŒπŒΩ should be absent from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last twelve</span></em> verses of S. Mark,

possible <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsuspiciousness‚Äù</span> can be supposed to result from the absence of

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> neither of them is wanted? <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> is the

Gospel,‚Äîor rather, why are <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last twelve verses‚Äù</span> of it,‚Äîto
labour under such special disfavor and discredit?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) Dr. Tregelles makes answer,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI am well aware that
arguments on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">style</span></em> are often very fallacious, and that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by
themselves</span></em> they prove very little: but when there does exist external
evidence, and when internal proofs as to style, manner,
verbal expression, and connection, are in accordance with
such independent grounds of forming a judgment; then these
internal considerations possess very great
weight.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_298" name="noteref_298" href="#note_298"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">298</span></span></a>‚ÄîFor all
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page170">[pg 170]</span><a name="Pg170" id="Pg170" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
rejoinder, the respected writer is asked,‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) But when
there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does not</span></em> exist any such external evidence: what then?
Next, he is reminded (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) That whether there does, or does
not, it is at least certain that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not one</span></em> of those <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúproofs as to
style,‚Äù</span> &amp;c., of which he speaks, has been able to stand
the test of strict examination. Not only is the precariousness
of all such Criticism as has been brought to bear against
the genuineness of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 excessive, but the
supposed facts adduced in evidence have been found out to
be every one of them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mistakes</span></em>;‚Äîbeing either, (1) demonstrably
without argumentative cogency of any kind;‚Äîor
else, (2) distinctly corroborative and confirmatory circumstances:
indications that this part of the Gospel is indeed by
S. Mark,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> that it is probably the work of another hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And thus the formidable enumeration of twenty-seven
grounds of suspicion vanishes out of sight: fourteen of them
proving to be frivolous and nugatory; and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thirteen</span></em>, more or
less clearly witnessing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in favour</span></em> of the section.<a id="noteref_299" name="noteref_299" href="#note_299"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">299</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. Of these thirteen expressions, some are even eloquent
in their witness. I am saying that it is impossible not to be
exceedingly struck by the discovery that this portion of the
Gospel contains (as I have explained already) so many indications
of S. Mark's undoubted manner. Such is the reference
to ·º° Œ∫œÑ·Ω∑œÉŒπœÇ (in ver. 15):‚Äîthe mention of ·ºÄœÄŒπœÉœÑ·Ω∑Œ± (in
ver. 14):‚Äîthe occurrence of the verb œÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ (in ver. 10
and 12),‚Äîof the phrase ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ·ΩÄŒΩ·ΩπŒºŒ±œÑ·Ω∑ ŒºŒøœÖ (in ver. 17),‚Äîand
of the phrase œáŒµ·øñœÅŒ±œÇ ·ºêœÑŒπœÑŒπŒ∏·Ω≥ŒΩŒ±Œπ ·ºêœÄ·Ω∑ œÑŒπŒΩŒ± (in ver. 18):‚Äîof the
Evangelical term for our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Ascension, viz. ·ºÄŒΩŒµŒª·ΩµœÜŒ∏Œ∑
(in ver. 19):‚Äîand lastly, of the compounds œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ
and ·ºêœÄŒ±Œ∫ŒøŒªŒøœÖŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ (in verses 17 and 20.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To these Thirteen, will have to be added all those other
notes of identity of authorship,‚Äîsuch as they are,‚Äîwhich
result from recurring identity of phrase, and of which the
assailants of this portion of the Gospel have prudently said
nothing. Such are the following:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xiv.) ·ºàŒΩ·Ω∑œÉœÑŒ±ŒΩŒ±Œπ, for rising <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from the dead</span></em>; which is one
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page171">[pg 171]</span><a name="Pg171" id="Pg171" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of S. Mark's words. Taking into account the shortness of
his Gospel, he has it thrice as often as S. Luke; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twelve times</span></em>
as often as S. Matthew or S. John.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xv.) The idiomatic expression œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖŒøŒº·Ω≥ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºÄŒ≥œÅ·ΩπŒΩ,
of which S. Matthew does not present a single specimen;
but which occurs three times in the short Gospel of S. Mark,<a id="noteref_300" name="noteref_300" href="#note_300"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">300</span></span></a>‚Äîof
which ver. 12 is one.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xvi.) The expression œÄœÅŒø·Ω∑ (in ver. 9,)‚Äîof which S. Mark
avails himself six times: i.e. (if the length of the present
Gospel be taken into account) almost five times as often as
either S. Matthew or S. John,‚ÄîS. Luke never using the word
at all. In his first chapter (ver. 35), and here in his last
(ver. 2), S. Mark uses Œª·Ω∑Œ±ŒΩ in connexion with œÄœÅŒø·Ω∑.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xvii.) The phrase Œ∫Œ∑œÅ·ΩªœÉœÉŒµŒπŒΩ œÑ·Ω∏ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥·Ω≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ (in ver. 15) is
another of S. Mark's phrases. Like S. Matthew, he employs
it four times (i. 14: xiii. 10: xiv. 9: xvi. 15): but it occurs
neither in S. Luke's nor in S. John's Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xviii.) The same <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">words</span></em> singly are characteristic of his
Gospel. Taking the length of their several narratives into
account, S. Mark has the word Œ∫Œ∑œÅ·ΩªœÉœÉŒµŒπŒΩ more than twice as
often as S. Matthew: three times as often as S. Luke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xix.) Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥·Ω≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ,‚Äîa word which occurs only in the first
two Gospels,‚Äîis found twice as often in S. Mark's as in
S. Matthew's Gospel: and if the respective length of their
Gospels be considered, the proportion will be as three to one.
It occurs, as above stated, in ver. 15.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xx.) If such Critics as Dr. Davidson had been concerned
to vindicate <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the genuineness</span></em> of this section of the Gospel, we
should have been assured that œÜŒ±ŒΩŒµœÅŒøœÖœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ is another of
S. Mark's words: by which they would have meant no more
than this,‚Äîthat though employed neither by S. Matthew
nor by S. Luke it is used thrice by S. Mark,‚Äîbeing found
twice in this section (verses 12, 14), as well as in ch. iv. 22.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxi.) They would have also pointed out that œÉŒ∫ŒªŒ∑œÅŒøŒ∫Œ±œÅŒ¥·Ω∑Œ±
is another of S. Mark's words: being employed neither by
S. Luke nor by S. John,‚Äîby S. Matthew only once,‚Äîbut
by S. Mark on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> occasions; of which ch. xvi. 14 is one.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page172">[pg 172]</span><a name="Pg172" id="Pg172" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxii.) In the same spirit, they would have bade us observe
that œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œáŒø·ø¶ (ver. 20)‚Äîunknown to S. Matthew and
S. John, and employed only once by S. Luke,‚Äîis <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">twice</span></em> used
by S. Mark; one instance occurring in the present section.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nor would it have been altogether unfair if they had
added that the precisely similar word œÄŒ±ŒΩœÑŒ±œá·ΩπŒ∏ŒµŒΩ (or œÄ·Ω±ŒΩœÑŒøŒ∏ŒµŒΩ)
is only found in this same Gospel,‚Äîviz. in ch. i. 45.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxiii.) They would further have insisted (and this time
with a greater show of reason) that the adverb Œ∫Œ±Œª·ø∂œÇ (which
is found in ver. 18) is another favorite word with S. Mark:
occurring as it does, (when the length of these several narratives
is taken into account,) more than twice as often in
S. Mark's as in S. John's Gospel,‚Äîjust three times as often
as in the Gospel of S. Matthew and S. Luke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxiv.) A more interesting (because a more just) observation
would have been that ·ºîœáŒµŒπŒΩ, in the sense of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto be,‚Äù</span> (as
in the phrase Œ∫Œ±Œª·ø∂œÇ ·ºîœáŒµŒπŒΩ, ver. 18,) is characteristic of
S. Mark. He has it oftener than any of the Evangelists,
viz. six times in all (ch. i. 32, 34: ii. 17: v. 23: vi. 55:
xvi. 18.) Taking the shortness of his Gospel into account,
he employs this idiom twice as often as S. Matthew;‚Äîthree
times as often as S. John;‚Äîfour times as often as S. Luke.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxv.) They would have told us further that ·ºÑ·ø§·ø•œâœÉœÑŒøœÇ is
another of S. Mark's favorite words: for that he has it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>
times,‚Äîviz. in ch. vi. 5, 13, and here in ver. 18. S. Matthew
has it only once. S. Luke and S. John not at all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxvi.) And we should have been certainly reminded by
them that the conjunction of œÄŒµŒΩŒ∏Œø·ø¶œÉŒπ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒªŒ±·Ω∑ŒøœÖœÉŒπ (in
ver. 10) is characteristic of S. Mark,‚Äîwho has Œ∫ŒªŒ±·Ω∑ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂
·ºÄŒªŒ±Œª·Ω±Œ∂ŒøŒΩœÑŒ±œÇ in ch. v. 38: Œ∏ŒøœÅœÖŒ≤Œµ·øñœÉŒ∏Œµ Œ∫Œ±Œπ Œ∫ŒªŒ±·Ω∑ŒµœÑŒµ in the
very next verse. As for œÄŒµŒΩŒ∏Œµ·øñŒΩ, it is one of the 123 words
common to S. Matthew and S. Mark, and peculiar to their
two Gospels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(xxvii.) Lastly, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúŒ∫Œ±œÑŒ±Œ∫œÅ·Ω∑ŒΩœâ (in ver. 16), instead of Œ∫œÅ·Ω∑ŒΩœâ,
is Mark's word, (comp. x. 33: xiv. 64).‚Äù</span> The simple verb
which is used four times by S. Matthew, five times by
S. Luke, nineteen times by S. John, is never at all employed
by S. Mark: whereas the compound verb he has oftener in
proportion than S. Matthew,‚Äîmore than twice as often as
either S. Luke or S. John.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page173">[pg 173]</span><a name="Pg173" id="Pg173" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Strange,‚Äîthat there should be exactly <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúxxvii‚Äù</span> notes of
genuineness discoverable in these twelve verses, instead of
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúXXVII‚Äù</span> grounds of suspicion!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But enough of all this. Here, we may with advantage
review the progress hitherto made in this inquiry.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I claim to have demonstrated long since that all those imposing
assertions respecting the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúStyle‚Äù</span> and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPhraseology‚Äù</span>
of this section of the Gospel which were rehearsed at the
outset,<a id="noteref_301" name="noteref_301" href="#note_301"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">301</span></span></a>‚Äîare
destitute of foundation. But from this discovery
alone there results a settled conviction which it will
be found difficult henceforth to disturb. A page of Scripture
which has been able to endure so severe an ordeal of
hostile inquiry, has been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proved</span></em> to be above suspicion. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em>
character is rightly accounted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">blameless</span></em> which comes out
unsullied after Calumny has done her worst; done it systematically;
done it with a will; done it for a hundred years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But this is not an adequate statement of the facts of the
case in respect of the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel. Something
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">more</span></em> is certain than that the charges which have been
so industriously brought against this portion of the Gospel are
without foundation. It has been also proved that instead of
there being discovered twenty-seven suspicious words and
phrases scattered up and down these twelve verses of the
Gospel, there actually exist exactly as many words and
phrases which attest with more or less certainty that those
verses are nothing else but the work of the Evangelist.

IV. And now it is high time to explain that though
I have hitherto condescended to adopt the method of my
opponents, I have only done so in order to shew that it
proves fatal to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">themselves</span></em>. I am, to say the truth, ashamed of
what has last been written,‚Äîso untrustworthy do I deem the
method which, (following the example of those who have
preceded me in this inquiry,) I have hitherto pursued. The
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúConcordance test,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> is probably as apt and intelligible
a designation as can be devised for the purely <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">mechanical</span></em>
process whereby it is proposed by a certain school of
Critics to judge of the authorship of Scripture,)‚Äîis about
the coarsest as well as about the most delusive that could be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page174">[pg 174]</span><a name="Pg174" id="Pg174" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
devised. By means of this clumsy and vulgar instrument,
especially when applied, (as in the case before us,) without
skill and discrimination, it would be just as easy to prove
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em> twelve verses of S. Mark's Gospel are of a suspicious
character as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last</span></em>.<a id="noteref_302" name="noteref_302" href="#note_302"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">302</span></span></a> In truth, except in very
skilful hands, it is no test at all, and can only mislead.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Thus, (in ver. 1,) we should be informed (i.) that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMark
nowhere uses the appellation <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus Christ</span></span>:‚Äù</span> and (ii.) that

reminded (iii.) that this Evangelist nowhere introduces any
of the Prophets by name, and that therefore the mention of

suspicious circumstance:‚Äî(iv.) that
a quotation from the Old Testament is <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúforeign to his manner,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(for
writers of this class would not hesitate to assume
that S. Mark xv. 28 is no part of the Gospel;)‚Äîand (v.) that
the fact that here are quotations from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> different prophets,
betrays an unskilful hand.‚Äî(vi.) Because S. Mark three times
calls Jud√¶a by its usual name (ŒôŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±ŒπŒ±, viz. in iii. 7: x. 1:
xiii. 14), the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unique</span></em> designation, ·º° ·º∏ŒøœÖŒ¥Œ±·Ω∑Œ± œá·ΩΩœÅŒ± (in ver. 5)
would be pronounced decisive against <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe authorship of

(in ver. 5) for <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe inhabitants of Jerusalem:‚Äù</span> we should

(viz. in verses 10, 11) yet elsewhere, when <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark</span></em> speaks
of Heaven, (ch. vi. 41: vii. 34: viii. 11: xvi. 19) he always
uses the singular.‚ÄîLastly, (xxv.) the same sorry objection
which was brought against the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlast twelve verses,‚Äù</span> (that
œÄ·Ω±ŒªŒπŒΩ, a favourite adverb with S. Mark, is not found there,)
is here even more conspicuous.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Turning away from all this,‚Äî(not, however, without an
apology for having lingered over such frivolous details so
long,)‚ÄîI desire to point out that we have reverently to look
below the surface, if we would ascertain how far it is to be
presumed from internal considerations whether S. Mark was
indeed the author of this portion of his Gospel, or not.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. We must devise, I say, some more delicate, more philosophical,
more <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">real</span></em> test than the coarse, uncritical expedient
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page176">[pg 176]</span><a name="Pg176" id="Pg176" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
which has been hitherto considered of ascertaining by reference
to the pages of a Greek Concordance whether a certain
word which is found in this section of the Gospel is, or is
not, used elsewhere by S. Mark. And I suppose it will be
generally allowed to be deserving of attention,‚Äîin fact, to
be a singularly corroborative circumstance,‚Äîthat within the
narrow compass of these Twelve Verses we meet with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every
principal characteristic of S. Mark's manner</span></em>:‚ÄîThus,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(i.) Though he is the Author of the shortest of the Gospels,
and though to all appearance he often merely reproduces
what S. Matthew has said before him, or else anticipates
something, which is afterwards delivered by S. Luke,‚Äîit
is surprising how often we are indebted to S. Mark for
precious pieces of information which we look for in vain
elsewhere. Now, this is a feature of the Evangelist's manner
which is susceptible of memorable illustration from the
section before us.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How many and how considerable are the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">new circumstances</span></em>
which S. Mark here delivers!‚Äî(1) That Mary Magdalene
was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em> to behold the risen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span>: (2)
That it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">He</span></em> who had cast out from her the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúseven devils:‚Äù</span> (3)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How the men were engaged</span></em> to whom she brought her joyful message,‚Äî(4)
who not only did not believe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">her</span></em> story, but when
Cleopas and his companion declared what had happened to
themselves, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">neither believed they them</span></em>.‚Äù</span> (5) The terms of
the Ministerial Commission, as set down in verses 15 and 16,
are unique. (6) The announcement of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsigns which
should follow them that believe‚Äù</span> is even extraordinary.
Lastly, (7) this is the only place in the Gospel where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The
Session at the right Hand of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em> is recorded.... So
many, and such precious incidents, showered into the Gospel Treasury
at the last moment, and with such a lavish hand, must
needs have proceeded if not from an Apostle at least from
a companion of Apostles. O, if we had no other token to
go by, there could not be a reasonable doubt that this entire
section is by no other than S. Mark himself!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(ii.) A second striking characteristic of the second Evangelist
is his love of picturesque, or at least of striking details,‚Äîhis
proneness to introduce exceedingly minute particulars,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page177">[pg 177]</span><a name="Pg177" id="Pg177" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
often of the profoundest significancy, and always of considerable
interest. Not to look beyond the Twelve Verses
(chap. i. 9-20) which were originally proposed for comparison,‚ÄîWe
are reminded (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) that in describing our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Baptism, it is only S. Mark who relates that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe
came <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from Nazareth</span></em>‚Äù</span> to be baptized.‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
In his highly elliptical account of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Temptation,
it is only he who relates that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with the wild
beasts</span></em>.‚Äù</span>‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) In his
description of the Call of the four Disciples, S. Mark alone
it is who, (notwithstanding the close resemblance of his
account to what is found in S. Matthew,) records that the
father of S. James and S. John was left <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin the ship <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with
the hired servants</span></em>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_304" name="noteref_304" href="#note_304"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">304</span></span></a>‚ÄîNow,
of this characteristic, we have
also within these twelve verses, at least four illustrations:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Note in ver. 10, that life-like touch which evidently
proceeded from an eye-witness,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúœÄŒµŒΩŒ∏Œø·ø¶œÉŒπ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ Œ∫ŒªŒ±·Ω∑ŒøœÖœÉŒπ.‚Äù</span>
S. Mark relates that when Mary conveyed to the Disciples
the joyous tidings of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> Resurrection,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">she found them overwhelmed with sorrow</span></em>,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmourning and weeping.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Note also that the unbelief recorded in ver. 13 is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recorded only there.</span></em>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) Again. S. Mark not only says that as the two Disciples
were <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgoing into the country,‚Äù</span> (œÄŒøœÅŒµœÖ·ΩπŒºŒµŒΩŒøŒπ Œµ·º∞œÇ ·ºÄŒ≥œÅ·ΩπŒΩ,<a id="noteref_305" name="noteref_305" href="#note_305"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">305</span></span></a>
ver. 12,) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> also <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwent with
them‚Äù</span>‚Äî(œÉœÖŒΩ-ŒµœÄŒøœÅŒµ·ΩªŒµœÑŒø, as
S. Luke relates;)‚Äîbut that it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as they actually </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwalked‚Äù</span><span style="font-style: italic">
along</span></em> (œÄŒµœÅŒπœÄŒ±œÑŒø·ø¶œÉŒπŒΩ) that this manifestation took place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) Among the marvellous predictions made concerning
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthem that believe;‚Äù</span> what can be imagined more striking
than the promise that they should <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">take up serpents</span></em>;‚Äù</span> and
suffer no harm even if they should <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">drink any deadly thing</span></em>‚Äù</span>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(iii) Next,‚Äîall have been struck, I suppose, with S. Mark's
proneness to substitute some expression of his own for what
he found in the Gospel of his predecessor S. Matthew: or,
when he anticipates something which is afterwards met with
in the Gospel of S. Luke, his aptness to deliver it in language
entirely independent of the later Evangelist. I allude,
for instance; to his substitution of ·ºêœÄŒπŒ≤Œ±Œª·ΩºŒΩ ·ºîŒ∫ŒªŒ±ŒπŒµ (xiv. 72)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page178">[pg 178]</span><a name="Pg178" id="Pg178" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
for S. Matthew's ·ºîŒ∫ŒªŒ±œÖœÉŒµ ŒºŒπŒ∫œÅ·ø∂œÇ (xxvi. 75);‚Äîand of ·ΩÅ œÑ·Ω≥Œ∫œÑœâŒΩ
(vi. 3) for ·ΩÅ œÑŒø·øß œÑ·Ω≥Œ∫œÑŒøŒΩŒøœÇ œÖŒπŒøœÇ (S. Matth. xiii. 55).‚ÄîThe
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwoman of Canaan‚Äù</span> in S. Matthew's Gospel (Œ≥œÖŒΩ·Ω¥ ŒßŒ±ŒΩŒ±ŒΩŒ±·Ω∑Œ±,
ch. xv. 22), is called <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa Greek, a Syrophenician by
nation‚Äù</span> in S. Mark's (·ºôŒªŒªŒ∑ŒΩ·Ω∂œÇ, Œ£œÖœÅŒøœÜŒø·Ω∑ŒΩŒπœÉœÉŒ± œÑ·ø∑ Œ≥·Ω≥ŒΩŒµŒπ,
ch. vii. 26).‚ÄîAt the Baptism, instead of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opened</span></em>‚Äù</span>
heavens of S. Matthew (·ºÄŒΩŒµ·ø∑œáŒ∏Œ∑œÉŒ±ŒΩ, ch. iii. 16) and S. Luke
(·ºÄŒΩŒµ·ø≥œáŒ∏·øÜŒΩŒ±Œπ, ch. iii. 22), we are presented by S. Mark with
the striking image of the heavens <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cleaving</span></em>‚Äù</span> or <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">being rent

œÑ·Ω∞ ·ΩÖœÅŒπŒ± ŒúŒ±Œ≥Œ¥Œ±Œª·Ω± (ch. xv. 39), S. Mark designates as œÑ·Ω∞
Œº·Ω≥œÅŒ∏ ŒîŒ±ŒªŒºŒ±ŒΩŒøœÖŒ∏·Ω± (ch. viii. 10.)‚ÄîIn place of S. Matthew's
Œ∂·ΩªŒºŒ∑ Œ£Œ±Œ¥Œ¥ŒøœÖŒ∫Œ±·Ω∑œâŒΩ (ch. xvi. 6), S. Mark has Œ∂·ΩªŒºŒ∑ ·º©œÅ·ΩΩŒ¥ŒøœÖ
(ch. viii. 15.)‚ÄîIn describing the visit to Jericho, for the Œ¥·ΩªŒø
œÑœÖœÜŒªŒø·Ω∑ of S. Matthew (ch. xx. 29), S. Mark gives œÖ·º±·Ω∏œÇ Œ§ŒπŒºŒ±·Ω∑ŒøœÖ
ŒíŒ±œÅœÑ·Ω∑ŒºŒ±ŒπŒøœÇ ·ΩÅ œÑœÖœÜŒª·Ω∏œÇ ... œÄœÅŒøœÉŒ±ŒπœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ (ch. ch. 46.)‚ÄîFor the
Œ∫Œª·Ω±Œ¥ŒøœÖœÇ of S. Matth. xxi. 8, S. Mark (ch. xi. 8) has œÉœÑŒøŒπŒ≤·Ω±Œ¥Œ±œÇ;
and for the other's œÄœÅ·Ω∂ŒΩ ·ºÄŒª·Ω≥Œ∫œÑŒøœÅŒ± œÜœâŒΩ·øÜœÉŒ±Œπ (xxvi.
34), he has œÄœÅ·Ω∂ŒΩ ·º¢ Œ¥·Ω∑œÇ (xiv. 30.)‚ÄîIt is so throughout.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Accordingly,‚Äî(as we have already more than once had occasion
to remark,)‚Äîwhereas the rest say only ·º° Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ,
S. Mark says œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ (in ver. 9).‚ÄîWhereas
S. Luke (viii. 2) says ·ºÄœÜ·æΩ ·ºßœÇ Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒº·ΩπŒΩŒπŒ± ·ºëœÄœÑ·Ω∞ ·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∑Œª·ΩªŒ∏ŒµŒπ,‚ÄîS.
Mark records that from her ·ºêŒ∫Œ≤ŒµŒ≤Œª·ΩµŒ∫ŒµŒπ ·ºëœÄœÑ·Ω∞ Œ¥Œ±ŒπŒº·ΩπŒΩŒπŒ±.‚ÄîVery
different is the great ministerial Commission as set
down by S. Mark in ver. 15, 16, from what is found in
S. Matthew xxviii. 19, 20.‚ÄîAnd whereas S. Luke says <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their
eyes were holden</span></em> that they should not know Him,‚Äù</span> S. Mark
says that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHe appeared to them <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in another form</span></em>.‚Äù</span> ... Is it
credible that any one fabricating a conclusion to S. Mark's
narrative after S. Luke's Gospel had appeared, would have
ventured so to paraphrase S. Luke's statement? And yet,
let the consistent truthfulness of either expression be carefully
noted. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Both</span></em> are historically accurate, but they proceed
from opposite points of view. Viewed on the heavenly
side, (God's side), the Disciples' <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúeyes‚Äù</span> (of course) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page179">[pg 179]</span><a name="Pg179" id="Pg179" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
holden</span></em>:‚Äù</span>‚Äîviewed on the earthly side, (Man's side), the risen
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> (no doubt) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appeared in another
form</span></em>.‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(iv.) Then further, S. Mark is observed to introduce many
expressions into his Gospel which confirm the prevalent
tradition that it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at Rome</span></em> he wrote it; and that it was
with an immediate view to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Latin</span></em> readers that it was published.
Twelve such expressions were enumerated above
(at p. <a href="#Pg150" class="tei tei-ref">150-1</a>); and such, it was also there shewn, most
unmistakably is the phrase œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ in ver. 9.‚ÄîIt is
simply incredible that any one but an Evangelist writing
under the peculiar conditions traditionally assigned to S.
Mark, would have hit upon such an expression as this,‚Äîthe
strict equivalent, to Latin ears, for ·º° Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ,
which has occurred just above, in ver. 2. Now this, it will
be remembered, is one of the hacknied objections to the genuineness
of this entire portion of the Gospel;‚Äîquite proof
enough, if proof were needed, of the exceeding <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">improbability</span></em>
which attaches to the phrase, in the judgment of those who
have considered this question the most.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(v.) The last peculiarity of S. Mark to which I propose
to invite attention is supplied by those expressions which
connect his Gospel with S. Peter, and remind us of the constant
traditional belief of the ancient Church that S. Mark

VI. But besides, and over and above such considerations
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page181">[pg 181]</span><a name="Pg181" id="Pg181" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as those which precede,‚Äî(some of which, I am aware, might
be considerably evacuated of their cogency; while others,
I am just as firmly convinced, will remain forcible witnesses
of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Truth to the end of Time,)‚ÄîI hesitate not to
avow my personal conviction that abundant and striking evidence
is garnered up within the brief compass of these Twelve
Verses that they are identical in respect of fabric with the
rest of the Gospel; were clearly manufactured out of the
same Divine materials,‚Äîwrought in the same heavenly loom.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It was even to have been expected, from what is found
to have been universally the method in other parts of Scripture,‚Äî(for
it was of course foreseen by <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Almighty God</span></span>
from the beginning that this portion of His Word would
be, like its Divine Author, in these last days cavilled at, reviled,
hated, rejected, denied,)‚Äîthat the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Spirit</span></span> would not
leave Himself without witness in this place. It was to have
been anticipated, I say, that Eternal Wisdom would carefully‚Äî(I
trust there is no irreverence in so speaking of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>
and His ways!)‚Äîwould carefully make provision: meet the
coming unbelief (as His Angel met Balaam) with a drawn
sword: plant up and down throughout these Twelve Verses
of the Gospel, sure indications of their Divine Original,‚Äîunmistakable
notes of purpose and design,‚Äîmysterious traces
and tokens of Himself; not visible indeed to the scornful
and arrogant, the impatient and irreverent; yet clear as if
written with a sunbeam to the patient and humble student,
the man who <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútrembleth at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>

Reader prefers the image,) the indications of a Divine Original
to be met with in these verses shall be likened rather
to those cryptic characters, invisible so long as they remain
unsuspected, but which shine forth clear and strong when
exposed to the Light or to the Heat; (Light and Heat, both
emblems of Himself!) so that even he that gropeth in darkness
must now see them, and admit that of a truth <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> is in this place‚Äù</span> although he <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúknew it not!‚Äù</span>

(i.) I propose then that in the first instance we compare
the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel with the beginning of it.
We did this before, when our object was to ascertain whether
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page182">[pg 182]</span><a name="Pg182" id="Pg182" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Style</span></em> of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 be indeed as utterly discordant
from that of the rest of the Gospel as is commonly
represented. We found, instead, the most striking resemblance.<a id="noteref_314" name="noteref_314" href="#note_314"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">314</span></span></a>
We also instituted a brief comparison between
the two in order to discover whether the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Diction</span></em> of the one
might not possibly be found as suggestive of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbal</span></em> doubts
as the diction of the other: and so we found it.<a id="noteref_315" name="noteref_315" href="#note_315"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">315</span></span></a>‚ÄîLet us
for the third time draw the two extremities of this precious
fabric into close proximity in order again to compare them.
Nothing I presume can be fairer than to elect that, once
more, our attention be chiefly directed to what is contained
within the twelve verses (ver. 9-20) of S. Mark's <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">first</span></em> chapter
which exactly correspond with the twelve verses of his <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last</span></em>
chapter (ver. 9-20) which are the subject of the present volume.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now between these two sections of the Gospel, besides
(1) the obvious <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">verbal</span></em> resemblance, I detect (2) a singular
parallelism of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">essential structure</span></em>. And this does not strike
me the less forcibly because nothing of the kind was to have

Hand of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span></em>‚Äù</span>‚Äîand <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">One Baptism for the
Remission of sins</span></em>,‚Äù</span>)
should be found at either extremity of one short Gospel,‚ÄîI
will but point out that it is certainly one of a very remarkable
series of fortuitous circumstances.‚ÄîBut in the
thing to be mentioned next, there neither is, nor can be,
any talk of fortuitousness at all.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) Allusion is made to the diversity of Name whereby
the Son of Man is indicated in these two several places of
the Gospel; which constitutes a most Divine circumstance,
and is profoundly significant. He who in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first</span></em> verse
(S. Mark i. 1) was designated by the joint title <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ‚Äù</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·ΩπœÇ,‚Äù</span>‚Äîhere, in the last two verses (S. Mark xvi.
19, 20) is styled for the first and for the last time, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú·Ωâ ŒöŒ•Œ°ŒôŒüŒ£‚Äù</span>‚Äîthe
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>.<a id="noteref_318" name="noteref_318" href="#note_318"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">318</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And why? Because He who at His Circumcision was
named <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span>,‚Äù</span> (a Name which was given Him from
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">His Birth</span></em>, yea, and before His Birth); He who at His Baptism
became <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>,‚Äù</span> (a Title which belonged to
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">His Office</span></em>, and which betokens His sacred <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Unction</span></em>);‚Äîthe
same, on the occasion of His Ascension into Heaven and Session at the
Right Hand of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>,‚Äîwhen (as we know) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúall power had
been given unto Him in Heaven and in Earth‚Äù</span> (S. Matth.
xxviii. 18),‚Äîis designated by His Name of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dominion</span></em>; <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>‚Äù</span> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jehovah</span></span> ... <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMagnifica

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I take leave to point out that all this is what never
either would or could have entered into the mind of a fabricator
of a conclusion to S. Mark's unfinished Gospel. No
inventor of a supplement, I say, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> have planted his foot
in this way in exactly the right place. The proof of my
assertion is twofold:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) First, because the present indication that the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Holy Ghost</span></span> was indeed the Author of these last Twelve Verses
is even appealed to by Dr. Davidson and his School, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as
a proof of a spurious original</span></em>. Verily, such Critics do not
recognise the token of the Divine Finger even when they <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">see</span></em> it!
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page186">[pg 186]</span><a name="Pg186" id="Pg186" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Next, as a matter of fact, we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">have</span></em>
a spurious Supplement to the Gospel,‚Äîthe same which was exhibited above
at p. <a href="#Pg123" class="tei tei-ref">123-4</a>; and which may here be with advantage reproduced
in its Latin form:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOmnia autem quaecumque praecepta
erant illis qui cum Petro erant, breviter exposuerunt.
Post haec et ipse Iesus adparuit, et ab oriente usque in
occidentem misit per illos sanctam et incorruptam praedicationem
salutis aeternae. Amen.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_319" name="noteref_319" href="#note_319"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">319</span></span></a>‚ÄîAnother
apocryphal termination is found in certain copies of the Thebaic version.
It occupies the place of ver. 20, and is as follows:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúExeuntes
terni in quatuor climata caeli praedicarunt Evangelium
in mundo toto, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christo</span></span> operante cum iis in verbo confirmationem
cum signis sequentibus eos et miraculis. Atque
hoc modo cognitum est regnum Dei in terra tota et in
mundo toto Israelis in testimonium gentium omnium harum
quae exsistunt ab oriente ad occasum.‚Äù</span> It will be seen
that the Title of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Dominion</span></em> (·ΩÅ Œö·ΩªœÅŒπŒøœÇ‚Äîthe
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>) is found
in neither of these fabricated passages; but the Names of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Nativity</span></em> and of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Baptism</span></em>
(·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ and ŒßœÅŒπœÉœÑ·ΩπœÇ‚Äî<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Jesus</span></span> and
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span>) occur instead.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(ii.) Then further:‚ÄîIt is an extraordinary note of
genuineness that such a vast number of minute but important
facts should be found accumulated within the narrow
compass of these twelve verses; and should be met with
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere else</span></em>. The writer,‚Äîsupposing that he had only
S. Matthew's Gospel before him,‚Äîtraverses (except in one
single instance) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">wholly new ground</span></em>; moves forward with
unmistakable boldness and a rare sense of security; and
wherever he plants his foot, it is to enrich the soil with
fertility and beauty. But on the supposition that he wrote
after S. Luke's and S. John's Gospel had appeared,‚Äîthe
marvel becomes increased an hundred-fold: for how then
does it come to pass that he evidently draws his information
from quite independent sources? is not bound by any of
their statements? even seems <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">purposely</span></em> to break away from
their guidance, and to adventure some extraordinary statement
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page187">[pg 187]</span><a name="Pg187" id="Pg187" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of his own,‚Äîwhich nevertheless carries the true Gospel
savour with it; and is felt to be authentic from the very
circumstance that no one would have ever dared to invent
such a detail and put it forth on his own responsibility?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(iii.) Second to no indication that this entire section of
the Gospel has a Divine original, I hold to be a famous
expression which (like œÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑŒ∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøœÖ) has occasioned
general offence: I mean, the designation of Mary Magdalene
as one <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúout of whom‚Äù</span> the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhad cast seven
devils;‚Äù</span> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>, in immediate connexion with the record of her
august privilege of being the first of the Human Race to
behold His risen form. There is such profound Gospel significancy;‚Äîsuch
sublime improbability,‚Äîsuch exquisite
pathos in this record,‚Äîthat I would defy any fabricator, be
he who he might, to have achieved it. This has been to
some extent pointed out already.<a id="noteref_320" name="noteref_320" href="#note_320"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">320</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(iv.) It has also been pointed out, (but the circumstance
must be by all means here insisted upon afresh,) that the designation
(found in ver. 10) of the little company of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
followers,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúœÑŒø·øñœÇ ŒºŒµœÑ·æΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ Œ≥ŒµŒΩŒøŒº·Ω≥ŒΩŒøŒπœÇ,‚Äù</span>‚Äîis another rare
note of veracious origin. No one but S. Mark,‚Äîor just such
an one as he,‚Äîwould or could have so accurately designated
the little band of Christian men and women who, unconscious
of their bliss, were <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmourning and weeping‚Äù</span> till after
sunrise on the first Easter Day. The reader is reminded of
what has been already offered on this subject, at p. <a href="#Pg155" class="tei tei-ref">155-6</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(v.) I venture further to point out that no writer but
S. Mark, (or such an one as he<a id="noteref_321" name="noteref_321" href="#note_321"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">321</span></span></a>), would have familiarly designated
the Apostolic body as <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúŒ±·ΩêœÑŒø·øñœÇ œÑŒø·øñœÇ ·ºîŒΩŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±,‚Äù</span> in ver. 14.
The phrase Œø·º± Œ¥·ΩΩŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ±, he uses in proportion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">far</span></em> oftener than
any other two of the Evangelists.<a id="noteref_322" name="noteref_322" href="#note_322"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">322</span></span></a> And it is evident that
the phrase Œø·º± ·ºïŒΩŒ¥ŒµŒ∫Œ± soon became an equally recognised designation
of the Apostolic body,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfrom which Judas by
transgression fell.‚Äù</span> Its familiar introduction into this place
by the second Evangelist is exactly what one might have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page188">[pg 188]</span><a name="Pg188" id="Pg188" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
looked for, or at least what one is fully prepared to meet
with, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in him</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(vi.) I will close this enumeration by calling attention to
an unobtrusive and unobserved verb in the last of these
verses which (I venture to say) it would never have entered
into the mind of any ordinary writer to employ in that
particular place. I allude to the familiar word ·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩπŒΩœÑŒµœÇ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The precise meaning of the expression,‚Äîdepending on the
known force of the preposition with which the verb is
compounded,‚Äîcan scarcely be missed by any one who, on
the one hand, is familiar with the Evangelical method;
on the other, is sufficiently acquainted with the Gospel
History. Reference is certainly made to the final departure
of the Apostolic body <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">out of the city of
Jerusalem</span></em>.<a id="noteref_323" name="noteref_323" href="#note_323"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">323</span></span></a> And tacitly, beyond a question, there is herein contained a recollection
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> command to His Apostles, twice
expressly recorded by S. Luke, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat they should <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not depart from
Jerusalem</span></em>, but wait for the promise of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>.‚Äù</span>
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold,‚Äù</span> (said He,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúI send the promise of My <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Father</span></span>

endued with power from on high.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_324" name="noteref_324" href="#note_324"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">324</span></span></a>... After many days <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">they went forth</span></em>‚Äù</span> or
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">out</span></em>.‚Äù</span> S. Mark, (or perhaps it is
rather S. Peter,) expressly says so,‚Äî·ºêŒæŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩπŒΩœÑŒµœÇ. Aye, and
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> was a memorable <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúoutgoing,‚Äù</span> truly! What else was
its purpose but the evangelization of the World?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. Let this suffice, then, concerning the evidence derived
from Internal considerations. But lest it should hereafter
be reckoned as an omission, and imputed to me as
a fault, that I have said nothing about the alleged <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Inconsistency</span></em>
of certain statements contained in these <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTwelve
Verses‚Äù</span> with the larger notices contained in the parallel
narratives of S. Luke and S. John,‚ÄîI proceed briefly to
explain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> I am silent on this head.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. I cannot see for whom I should be writing; in other
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page189">[pg 189]</span><a name="Pg189" id="Pg189" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
words,‚Äîwhat I should propose to myself as the end to be
attained by what I wrote. For,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. What would be gained by demonstrating,‚Äî(as I am
of course prepared to do,)‚Äîthat there is really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no inconsistency
whatever</span></em> between anything which S. Mark here says,
and what the other Evangelists deliver? I should have
proved that,‚Äî(assuming the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em> Evangelical narratives to
be authentic, i.e. historically true,)‚Äîthe narrative before us
cannot be objected to on the score of its not being authentic
also. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by whom</span></em> is such proof required?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) Not by the men who insist that errors are occasionally
to be met with in the Evangelical narratives. In <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their</span></em> estimation,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the genuineness of an inspired writing</span></em> is a thing not
in the least degree rendered suspicious by the erroneousness
of its statements. According to them, the narrative may
exhibit inaccuracies and inconsistencies, and may yet be the
work of S. Mark. If the inconsistencies be but <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äútrifling,‚Äù</span>
and the inaccuracies <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúminute,‚Äù</span>‚Äîthese <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúsound Theologians,‚Äù</span>
(for so they style themselves,<a id="noteref_325" name="noteref_325" href="#note_325"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">325</span></span></a>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhave no dread whatever
of acknowledging‚Äù</span> their existence. Be it so. Then would
it be a gratuitous task to set about convincing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">them</span></em> that
no inconsistency, no inaccuracy is discoverable within the
compass of these Twelve concluding Verses.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) But neither is such proof required by faithful Readers;
who, for want of the requisite Scientific knowledge, are
unable to discern the perfect Harmony of the Evangelical
narratives in this place. It is only one of many places
where a prim√¢ facie discrepancy, though it does not fail to
strike,‚Äîyet (happily) altogether fails to distress them.
Consciously or unconsciously, such readers reason with themselves
somewhat as follows:‚Äî"<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Word,
like all <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>
other Works, (and I am taught to regard <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span> Word as
a very masterpiece of creative skill;)‚Äîthe blessed Gospel,
I say, is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">full</span></em> of difficulties. And yet those difficulties are
observed invariably to disappear under competent investigation.
Can I seriously doubt that if sufficient critical skill
were brought to bear on the highly elliptical portion of narrative
contained in these Twelve Verses, it would present no
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page190">[pg 190]</span><a name="Pg190" id="Pg190" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
exception to a rule which is observed to be else universal;
and that any apparent inconsistency between S. Mark's
statements in this place, and those of S. Luke and S. John,
would also be found to be imaginary only?"
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This then is the reason why I abstain from entering upon
a prolonged Inquiry, which would in fact necessitate a discussion
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Principles of Gospel Harmony</span></em>,‚Äîfor which the
present would clearly not be the proper place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. Let it suffice that, in the foregoing pages,‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. I have shewn that the supposed argument from <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúStyle,‚Äù</span>
(in itself a highly fallacious test,) disappears under investigation.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It has been proved (pp. <a href="#Pg142" class="tei tei-ref">142-5</a>) that, on the contrary, the
style of S. Mark xvi. 9-20 is exceedingly like the style of
S. Mark i. 9-20; and therefore, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it is rendered probable
by the Style</span></em> that the Author of the beginning of this Gospel
was also the Author of the end of it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. I have further shewn that the supposed argument
from <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPhraseology,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(in itself, a most unsatisfactory test;
and as it has been applied to the matter in hand, a very
coarse and clumsy one;)‚Äîbreaks down hopelessly under
severe analysis.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Instead of there being twenty-seven suspicious circumstances
in the Phraseology of these Twelve Verses, it has
been proved (pp. <a href="#Pg170" class="tei tei-ref">170-3</a>) that in twenty-seven particulars there
emerge <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">corroborative considerations</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Lastly, I have shewn that a loftier method of Criticism
is at hand; and that, tested by this truer, more judicious,
and more philosophical standard; <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a presumption</span></em> of the highest
order is created <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that these Verses must needs be the work
of S. Mark</span></em>.

by without so much as a word of comment,
by those who have preceded me in this inquiry. Yet is it,
when rightly understood, altogether decisive of the question
at issue. And why? Because it is not the testimony rendered
by a solitary father or by a solitary MS.; no, nor
even the testimony yielded by a single Church, or by
a single family of MSS. But it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the united testimony of all

so, it comes to us like the voice of many waters: dates, (as
I shall shew by-and-by,) from a period of altogether immemorial

ages: admits of neither doubt nor evasion. This
subject, in order that it may be intelligibly handled, will be
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page192">[pg 192]</span><a name="Pg192" id="Pg192" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
most conveniently approached by some remarks which shall
rehearse the matter from the beginning.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The Christian Church succeeded to the Jewish. The
younger society inherited the traditions of the elder, not less
as a measure of necessity than as a matter of right; and by
a kind of sacred instinct conformed itself from the very beginning
in countless particulars to its divinely-appointed
model. The same general Order of Service went on unbroken,‚Äîconducted
by a Priesthood whose spiritual succession
was at least as jealously guarded as had been the natural
descent from Aaron in the Church of the Circumcision.<a id="noteref_327" name="noteref_327" href="#note_327"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">327</span></span></a> It
was found that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Sacraments of the Jews are [but] types
of ours.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_328" name="noteref_328" href="#note_328"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">328</span></span></a> Still were David's Psalms antiphonally recited,
and the voices of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMoses and the Prophets‚Äù</span> were heard in
the sacred assemblies of God's people <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúevery Sabbath day.‚Äù</span>
Canticle succeeded to Canticle; while many a Versicle simply
held its ground. The congenial utterances of the chosen
race passed readily into the service of the family of the redeemed.
Unconsciously perhaps, the very method of the
one became adopted by the other: as, for example, the method
of beginning a festival from the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEve‚Äù</span> of the preceding
Day. The Synagogue-worship became transfigured;
but it did not part with one of its characteristic features.
Above all, the same three great Festivals were still retained
which declare <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe rock whence we are hewn and the hole
of the pit whence we are digged:‚Äù</span> only was it made a question,
a controversy rather, whether Easter should or should
not be celebrated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with the Jews</span></em>.<a id="noteref_329" name="noteref_329" href="#note_329"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">329</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it is the faithful handing on to the Christian community
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Lectionary practice</span></em> of the Synagogue to which the
reader's attention is now exclusively invited. That the Christian
Church inherited from the Jewish the practice of reading
a first and a second Lesson in its public assemblies, is
demonstrable. What the Synagogue practice was in the
time of the Apostles is known from Acts xiii. 15, 27. Justin
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page193">[pg 193]</span><a name="Pg193" id="Pg193" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Martyr, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 150) describes the Christian practice in his
time as precisely similar:<a id="noteref_330" name="noteref_330" href="#note_330"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">330</span></span></a> only that for <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Law,‚Äù</span> there
is found to have been at once substituted <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Gospel.‚Äù</span> He
speaks of the writings of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Apostles</span></em>‚Äù</span> and of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Prophets.‚Äù</span>
Chrysostom has the same expression (for the two
Lessons) in one of his Homilies.<a id="noteref_331" name="noteref_331" href="#note_331"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">331</span></span></a> Cassian (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 400) says that
in Egypt, after the Twelve Prayers at Vespers and at Matins,
two Lessons were read, one out of the Old Testament and
the other out of the New. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on Saturdays</span></em> and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sundays</span></em>,
and the fifty days of Pentecost, both Lessons were from the
New Testament,‚Äîone from the Epistles or the Acts of the
Apostles; the other, from the Gospels.<a id="noteref_332" name="noteref_332" href="#note_332"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">332</span></span></a> Our own actual
practice seems to bear a striking resemblance to that of the
Christian Church at the earliest period: for we hear of (1)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMoses and the Prophets,‚Äù</span> (which will have been the carrying
on of the old synagogue-method, represented by our
first and second Lesson,)‚Äî(2) a lesson out of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpistles
or Acts,‚Äù</span> together with a lesson out of the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGospels.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_333" name="noteref_333" href="#note_333"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">333</span></span></a>
It is, in fact, universally received that the Eastern Church
has, from a period of even Apostolic antiquity, enjoyed a Lectionary,‚Äîor
established system of Scripture lessons,‚Äîof her
own. In its conception, this Lectionary is discovered to
have been fashioned (as was natural) upon the model of the
Lectionary of God's ancient people, the Jews: for it commences,
as theirs did, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the autumn</span></em>, (in September<a id="noteref_334" name="noteref_334" href="#note_334"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">334</span></span></a>); and
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page194">[pg 194]</span><a name="Pg194" id="Pg194" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
prescribes two immovable <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLections‚Äù</span> for every <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Saturday</span></em> (as
well as for every Sunday) in the year: differing chiefly in
this,‚Äîthat the prominent place which had been hitherto assigned
to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Law and the Prophets,‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_335" name="noteref_335" href="#note_335"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">335</span></span></a> was henceforth
enjoyed by the Gospels and the Apostolic writings. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSaturday-Sunday‚Äù</span>
lections‚Äî(œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫Œ±·Ω∑, for so these Lections
were called,)‚Äîretain their place in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSynaxarium‚Äù</span>
of the East to the present hour. It seems also a singular note
of antiquity that the Sabbath and the Sunday succeeding it
do as it were cohere, and bear one appellation; so that the
week takes its name‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> from the Sunday with which it
commences,<a id="noteref_336" name="noteref_336" href="#note_336"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">336</span></span></a> but‚Äîfrom the Sabbath-and-Sunday with which
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it concludes</span></em>. To mention only one out of a hundred minute
traits of identity which the public Service of the sanctuary
retained:‚ÄîEaster Eve, which from the earliest period to
this day has been called <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúŒº·Ω≥Œ≥Œ± œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ,‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_337" name="noteref_337" href="#note_337"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">337</span></span></a> is discovered
to have borne the self-same appellation in the Church of the
Circumcision.<a id="noteref_338" name="noteref_338" href="#note_338"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">338</span></span></a>‚ÄîIf I do not enter more
minutely into the structure of the Oriental Lectionary,‚Äî(some will perhaps
think I have said too much, but the interest of the subject
ought to be a sufficient apology,)‚Äîit is because further details
would be irrelevant to my present purpose; which is
only to call attention to the three following facts:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(I.) That the practice in the Christian Church of reading
publicly before the congregation certain fixed portions of
Holy Writ, according to an established and generally received
rule, must have existed from a period long anterior
to the date of any known Greek copy of the New Testament
Scriptures.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(II.) That although there happens to be extant neither
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSynaxarium,‚Äù</span> (i.e. Table of Proper Lessons of the Greek
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page195">[pg 195]</span><a name="Pg195" id="Pg195" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Church), nor <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEvangelistarium,‚Äù</span> (i.e. Book containing the
Ecclesiastical Lections <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in extenso</span></span>), of higher antiquity than
the viii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,‚Äîyet
that the scheme itself, as exhibited by those monuments,‚Äîcertainly in every
essential particular,‚Äîis older than any known Greek MS. which contains
it, by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least</span></em> four, in fact by full <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">five</span></em> hundred years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(III.) Lastly,‚ÄîThat in the said Lectionaries of the
Greek and of the Syrian Churches, the twelve concluding
verses of S. Mark which are the subject of discussion throughout
the present pages are observed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> to occupy the
same singularly conspicuous, as well as most honourable
place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. The first of the foregoing propositions is an established
fact. It is at least quite certain that in the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century (if not long before) there existed
a known Lectionary system, alike in the Church of the East and of the West. Cyril of
Jerusalem (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 348,) having to speak about our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>'s Ascension, remarks that by a providential coincidence,
on the previous day, which was Sunday, the event had formed the
subject of the appointed lessons;<a id="noteref_339" name="noteref_339" href="#note_339"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">339</span></span></a> and that he had availed
himself of the occasion to discourse largely on the subject.‚ÄîChrysostom,
preaching at Antioch, makes it plain that, in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page196">[pg 196]</span><a name="Pg196" id="Pg196" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the latter part of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, the
order of the lessons which were publicly read in the Church <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on Saturdays and
Sundays</span></em><a id="noteref_340" name="noteref_340" href="#note_340"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">340</span></span></a> was familiarly known to the congregation: for he
invites them to sit down, and study attentively beforehand,
at home, the Sections (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄ·Ω±œÇ) of the Gospel which they
were about to hear in Church.<a id="noteref_341" name="noteref_341" href="#note_341"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">341</span></span></a>‚ÄîAugustine is express in
recording that in his time proper lessons were appointed for
Festival days;<a id="noteref_342" name="noteref_342" href="#note_342"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">342</span></span></a> and that an innovation which he had attempted
on Good Friday had given general offence.<a id="noteref_343" name="noteref_343" href="#note_343"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">343</span></span></a>‚ÄîNow
by these few notices, to look no further, it is rendered certain
that a Lectionary system of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> sort must have been
in existence at a period long anterior to the date of any copy
of the New Testament Scriptures extant. I shall shew
by-and-by that the fact is established by the Codices (B,
◊ê, A, C, D) themselves.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we may go back further yet; for not only Eusebius,
but Origen and Clemens Alexandrinus, by their habitual
use of the technical term for an Ecclesiastical Lection (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄ·Ωµ,
·ºÄŒΩ·Ω±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒπœÇ, ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω±Œ≥ŒΩœâœÉŒºŒ±,) remind us that the Lectionary
practice of the East was already established in
their days.<a id="noteref_344" name="noteref_344" href="#note_344"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">344</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. The Oriental Lectionary consists of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSynaxarion‚Äù</span>
and <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEclogadion,‚Äù</span> (or Tables of Proper Lessons from the
Gospels and Apostolic writings daily throughout the year;)
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page197">[pg 197]</span><a name="Pg197" id="Pg197" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
together with <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMenologion,‚Äù</span> (or Calendar of immovable
Festivals and Saints' Days.) That we are thoroughly acquainted
with all of these, as exhibited in Codices of the
viii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>,
ix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> and
x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> centuries,‚Äîis a familiar fact;
in illustration of which it is enough to refer the reader to the
works cited at the foot of the page.<a id="noteref_345" name="noteref_345" href="#note_345"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">345</span></span></a> But it is no less certain
that the scheme of Proper Lessons itself is of much
higher antiquity.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. The proof of this, if it could only be established by an
induction of particular instances, would not only be very
tedious, but also very difficult indeed. It will be perceived,
on reflection, that even when the occasion of a Homily (suppose)
is actually recorded, the Scripture references which
it contains, apart from the Author's statement that what
he quotes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had</span></em> formed part of that day's Service, creates
scarcely so much as a presumption of the fact: while the
correspondence, however striking, between such references
to Scripture and the Lectionary as we have it, is of course
no proof whatever that we are so far in possession of the
Lectionary of the Patristic age. Nay, on famous Festivals,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page198">[pg 198]</span><a name="Pg198" id="Pg198" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the employment of certain passages of Scripture is, in
a manner, inevitable,<a id="noteref_346" name="noteref_346" href="#note_346"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">346</span></span></a> and may on no account be pressed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Thus, when Chrysostom<a id="noteref_347" name="noteref_347" href="#note_347"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">347</span></span></a> and when
Epiphanius,<a id="noteref_348" name="noteref_348" href="#note_348"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">348</span></span></a> preaching
on Ascension Day, refer to Acts i. 10, 11,‚Äîwe do not
feel ourselves warranted to press the coincidence of such
a quotation with the Liturgical section of the day.‚ÄîSo,
again, when Chrysostom preaches on Christmas Day, and
quotes from S. Matthew ii. 1, 2;<a id="noteref_349" name="noteref_349" href="#note_349"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">349</span></span></a> or on Whitsunday, and
quotes from S. John vii. 38 and Acts ii. 3 and 13;‚Äîthough
both places form part of the Liturgical sections for the day, no
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">proof</span></em> results therefrom that either chapter was actually used.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. But we are not reduced to this method. It is discovered
that nearly three-fourths of Chrysostom's Homilies
on S. Matthew either begin at the first verse of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a known
Ecclesiastical Lection</span></em>; or else at the first ensuing verse after
the close of one. Thirteen of those Homilies in succession
(the 63rd to the 75th inclusive) begin with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the first words of
as many known Lections</span></em>. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúLet us attend to this delightful
section (œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄ·Ωµ) which we never cease turning to,‚Äù</span>‚Äîare
the opening words of Chrysostom's 79th Homily, of which
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe text‚Äù</span> is S. Matth. xxv. 31, i.e. the beginning of the
Gospel for Sexagesima Sunday.‚ÄîCyril of Alexandria's (so
called) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCommentary on S. Luke‚Äù</span> is nothing else but a
series of short Sermons, for the most part delivered on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">known
Ecclesiastical Lections</span></em>; which does not seem to have been as
yet observed.‚ÄîAugustine (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 416) says expressly that he
had handled S. John's Gospel in precisely the same way.<a id="noteref_350" name="noteref_350" href="#note_350"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">350</span></span></a>‚ÄîAll this is significant in a high degree.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. I proceed, however, to adduce a few distinct proofs that
the existing Lectionary of the great Eastern Church,‚Äîas it
is exhibited by Matthaei, by Scholz, and by Scrivener from
MSS. of the viii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,‚Äîand
which is contained in Syriac MSS. of the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
and vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>‚Äîmust needs be in the main
a work of extraordinary antiquity. And if I do not begin
by insisting that at least one century more may be claimed
for it by a mere appeal to the Hierosolymitan Version, it is
only because I will never knowingly admit what may prove
to be untrustworthy materials<a id="noteref_351" name="noteref_351" href="#note_351"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">351</span></span></a> into my foundations.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEvery one is aware,‚Äù</span> (says Chrysostom in a sermon
on our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> Baptism, preached at Antioch,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 387,)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthat this is called the Festival of the Epiphany. Two
manifestations are thereby intended: concerning both of
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">you have heard this day S. Paul discourse in his Epistle

Then follows a quotation from ch. ii. 11 to 13,‚Äîwhich
proves to be the beginning of the lection for the
day in the Greek Menology. In the time of Chrysostom,
therefore, Titus ii. 11, 12, 13 formed part of one of the
Epiphany lessons,‚Äîas it does to this hour in the Eastern
Church. What is scarcely less interesting, it is also found
to have been part of the Epistle for the Epiphany in the
old Gallican Liturgy,<a id="noteref_353" name="noteref_353" href="#note_353"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">353</span></span></a> the affinities of which with the
East are well known.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) Epiphanius (speaking of the Feasts of the Church)
says, that at the Nativity, a Star shewed that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Word</span></span>
had become incarnate: at the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTheophania‚Äù</span> (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEpiphany‚Äù</span>)
John cried, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBehold the Lamb of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>,‚Äù</span> &amp;c., and
a Voice from Heaven proclaimed Him at His Baptism. Accordingly,
S. Matth. ii. 1-12 is found to be the ancient
lection for Christmas Day: S. Mark i. 9-11 and S. Matth.
iii. 13-17 the lections for Epiphany. On the morrow, was
read S. John i. 29-34.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) In another of his Homilies, Chrysostom explains with
considerable emphasis the reason why the Book of the Acts
was read publicly in Church during the interval between
Easter and Pentecost; remarking, that it had been the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page200">[pg 200]</span><a name="Pg200" id="Pg200" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
liturgical arrangement of a yet earlier
age.<a id="noteref_354" name="noteref_354" href="#note_354"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">354</span></span></a>‚ÄîAfter such an
announcement, it becomes a very striking circumstance that
Augustine also (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 412) should be found to bear witness to
the prevalence of the same liturgical arrangement in the
African Church.<a id="noteref_355" name="noteref_355" href="#note_355"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">355</span></span></a> In the old Gallican Lectionary, as might
have been expected, the same rule is recognisable. It ought
to be needless to add that the same arrangement is observed
universally to prevail in the Lectionaries both of the East
and of the West to the present hour; although the fact
must have been lost sight of by the individuals who recently,
under pretence of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">making some advantageous alterations</span></em>‚Äù</span>
in our Lectionary, have constructed an entirely new one,‚Äîvicious
in principle and liable to the gravest objections

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">d</span></span>) The purely arbitrary arrangement, (as Mr. Scrivener

is discovered to have been fully recognised in the time of

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>) It will be seen in the next chapter that it was from
a very remote period the practice of the Eastern Church
to introduce into the lesson for Thursday in Holy-week,
S. Luke's account (ch. xxii. 43, 44) of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAgony

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> is, no doubt, the reason why Chrysostom,‚Äîwho has
been suspected, (I think unreasonably,) of employing an
Evangelistarium instead of a copy of the Gospels in the
preparation of his Homilies, is observed to quote those same
two verses in that very place in his Homily on S.

which shews that the Lectionary system of the Eastern
Church in this respect is at least as old as the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) The same two verses used to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">left out</span></em>

why Cyril (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 425) in his Homilies on S. Luke,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But we can carry back the witness to the Lectionary practice
of omitting these verses, at least a hundred years; for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page202">[pg 202]</span><a name="Pg202" id="Pg202" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Cod. B, (evidently for that same reason,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">also</span></em> omits them,
as was stated above, in p. <a href="#Pg079" class="tei tei-ref">79</a>. They are wanting also in the
Thebaic version, which is of the iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g</span></span>) It will be found suggested in the next chapter (page
<a href="#Pg218" class="tei tei-ref">218</a>) that the piercing of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> side, (S. John xix. 34),‚Äîthrust
into Codd. B and ◊ê immediately after S. Matth.
xxvii. 49,‚Äîis probably indebted for its place in those two
MSS. to the Eastern Lectionary practice. If this suggestion
be well founded, a fresh proof is obtained that the Lectionary
of the East was fully established in the beginning
of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century. But see
<a href="#Appendix_H" class="tei tei-ref">Appendix (H)</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">h</span></span>) It is a remarkable note of the antiquity of that
Oriental Lectionary system with which we are acquainted,
that S. Matthew's account of the Passion (ch. xxvii. 1-61,)
should be there appointed to be read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> on the evening
of Good Friday. Chrysostom clearly alludes to this practice;<a id="noteref_361" name="noteref_361" href="#note_361"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">361</span></span></a>
which Augustine expressly states was also the practice
in his own day.<a id="noteref_362" name="noteref_362" href="#note_362"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">362</span></span></a> Traces of the same method are
discoverable in the old Gallican

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">i</span></span>) Epiphanius, (or the namesake of his who was the
author of a well-known Homily on Palm Sunday,) remarks
that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúyesterday‚Äù</span> had been read the history of the rising
of Lazarus.<a id="noteref_364" name="noteref_364" href="#note_364"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">364</span></span></a>
Now S. John xi. 1-45 is the lection for the
antecedent Sabbath, in all the Lectionaries.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">k</span></span>) In conclusion, I may be allowed so far to anticipate
what will be found fully established in the next chapter, as
to point out here that since in countless places the text of
our oldest Evangelia as well as the readings of the primitive
Fathers exhibit unmistakable traces of the corrupting
influence of the Lectionary practice, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> very fact becomes
irrefragable evidence of the antiquity of the Lectionary
which is the occasion of it. Not only must it be more
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page203">[pg 203]</span><a name="Pg203" id="Pg203" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ancient than Cod. B or Cod. ◊ê, (which are referred to the
beginning of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century), but it must
be older than Origen in the iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century, or
the Vetus Itala and the Syriac in the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span>.
And thus it is demonstrated, (1st) That fixed
Lessons were read in the Churches of the East in the immediately
post-Apostolic age; and (2ndly) That, wherever
we are able to test it, the Lectionary of that remote period
corresponded with the Lectionary which has come down to
us in documents of the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> and
vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: syper">th</span></span> century, and was in
fact constructed in precisely the same way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I am content in fact to dismiss the preceding instances
with this general remark:‚Äîthat a System which is found
to have been fully recognised throughout the East and
throughout the West in the beginning of the fourth century,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">must of necessity have been established very long before</span></em>. It is
as when we read of three British Bishops attending the
Council at Arles, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 314. The Church (we say) which
could send out those three Bishops must have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fully
organized</span></em> at a greatly antecedent period.

4. Let us attend, however, to the great Festivals of the
Church. These are declared by Chrysostom (in a Homily
delivered at Antioch 20 Dec. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 386) to be the five
following:‚Äî(1) Nativity: (2) the Theophania: (3) Pascha: (4)
Ascension: (5) Pentecost.<a id="noteref_365" name="noteref_365" href="#note_365"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">365</span></span></a> Epiphanius, his contemporary,
(Bishop of Constantia in the island of Cyprus,) makes the
same enumeration,<a id="noteref_366" name="noteref_366" href="#note_366"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">366</span></span></a>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page204">[pg 204]</span><a name="Pg204" id="Pg204" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is plain that the preceding enumeration could not have
been made at any earlier period: for the Epiphany of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> and His Nativity were originally but one
Festival.<a id="noteref_369" name="noteref_369" href="#note_369"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">369</span></span></a> Moreover, the circumstances are well known under which
Chrysostom (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 386) announced to his Eastern auditory
that in conformity with what had been correctly ascertained
at Rome, the ancient Festival was henceforth to be
disintegrated.<a id="noteref_370" name="noteref_370" href="#note_370"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">370</span></span></a>

We know that, as a matter of fact, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Epiphanies‚Äù</span> (for
œÑ·Ω∞ ·ºêœÄŒπœÜŒ±ŒΩ·Ω∑Œ± is the name of the Festival) became in consequence

testifies that the conclusion of S. Mark's Gospel was
in his days, as it has been ever since, one of the lections for
Easter. He begins by saying that the Evangelical narratives
of the Resurrection were read on the Sunday night; and
proceeds to reconcile <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark's</span></em> with the rest.‚ÄîChrysostom
once and again adverts to the practice of discontinuing the
reading of the Acts after Pentecost,<a id="noteref_374" name="noteref_374" href="#note_374"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">374</span></span></a>‚Äîwhich

III. I speak separately of the Festival of the Ascension,
for an obvious reason. It ranked, as we have seen, in the
estimation of Primitive Christendom, with the greatest Festivals
of the Church. Augustine, in a well-known passage,
hints that it may have been of Apostolical origin;<a id="noteref_375" name="noteref_375" href="#note_375"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">375</span></span></a> so
exceedingly

remote was its institution accounted in the days of
the great African Father, as well as so entirely forgotten by
that time was its first beginning. I have to shew that in
the Great Oriental Lectionary (whether of the Greek or of
the Syrian Church) the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's
Gospel occupy a conspicuous as well as a most honourable
place. And this is easily done: for,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) The Lesson for Matins <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">on Ascension-Day</span></em> in the
East, in the oldest documents to which we have access, consisted
(as now it does) of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last Twelve Verses</span></em>,‚Äîneither more nor
less,‚Äîof S. Mark's Gospel. At the Liturgy on Ascension was
read S. Luke xxiv. 36-53: but at Matins, S. Mark xvi. 9-20.
The witness of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSynaxaria‚Äù</span> is constant to this effect.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) The same lection precisely was adopted among the
Syrians by the Melchite Churches,<a id="noteref_376" name="noteref_376" href="#note_376"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">376</span></span></a>‚Äî(the

the Monophysite) Churches of Syria, a striking difference
of arrangement is discoverable. While S. Luke xxiv. 36-53
was read at Vespers and at Matins on Ascension Day,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last seven</span></em> verses of S. Mark's Gospel (ch. xvi. 14-20)
were read <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at the Liturgy</span></em>.<a id="noteref_378" name="noteref_378" href="#note_378"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">378</span></span></a> Strange, that the self-same Gospel

been essentially one and the same in the West<a id="noteref_390" name="noteref_390" href="#note_390"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">390</span></span></a> and in the
East. That it must have been of even Apostolic antiquity
may be inferred from several considerations. But that it
dates its beginning from a period <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">anterior to the age of
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page208">[pg 208]</span><a name="Pg208" id="Pg208" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
Eusebius,‚Äîwhich is the age of Codices B and</span></em> ◊ê,‚Äîat least
admits of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> controversy.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) Next,‚ÄîDocuments of the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century put us in possession of the great Oriental Lectionary as it is found at
that time to have universally prevailed throughout the vast
unchanging East. In other words, several of the actual
Service Books, in Greek and in Syriac,<a id="noteref_391" name="noteref_391" href="#note_391"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">391</span></span></a> have survived the
accidents of full a thousand years: and rubricated copies
of the Gospels carry us back three centuries further. The
entire agreement which is observed to prevail among these
several documents,‚Äîadded to the fact that when tested by
the allusions incidentally made by Greek Fathers of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century to what was the Ecclesiastical practice of their own
time, there are found to emerge countless as well as highly
significant notes of correspondence,‚Äîwarrants us in believing,
(in the absence of testimony of any sort to the contrary,)
that the Lectionary we speak of differs in no essential
respect from that system of Lections with which
the Church of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century was universally acquainted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Nothing scarcely is more forcibly impressed upon us in
the course of the present inquiry than the fact, that documents
alone are wanting to make <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> altogether demonstrable
which, in default of such evidence, must remain
a matter of inevitable inference only. The forms we are
pursuing at last disappear from our sight: but it is only the
mist of the early morning which shrouds them. We still
hear their voices: still track their footsteps: know that
others still see them, although we ourselves see them no
longer. We are sure that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there they still are</span></em>. Moreover they
may yet reappear at any moment. Thus, there exist Syriac
MSS. of the Gospels of the vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> and even of
the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,
in which the Lessons are rubricated in the text or on the
margin. A Syriac MS. (of part of the Old T.) is actually
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">dated</span></em> <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 464.<a id="noteref_392" name="noteref_392" href="#note_392"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">392</span></span></a> Should an
Evangelium of similar date
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page209">[pg 209]</span><a name="Pg209" id="Pg209" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
ever come to light of which the rubrication was evidently by
the original Scribe, the evidence of the Lectionaries would
at once be carried back full three hundred years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in fact we stand in need of no such testimony. Acceptable
as it would be, it is plain that it would add no
strength to the argument whatever. We are already able
to plant our footsteps securely in the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
and even in the iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century. It is not
enough to insist that inasmuch as the Liturgical method of Christendom was at least fully
established in the East and in the West at the close of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, it therefore must have had its
beginning at a far remoter period. Our two oldest Codices (B and ◊ê)
bear witness throughout to the corrupting influence of a system
which was evidently in full operation before the time
of Eusebius. And even this is not all. The readings in
Origen, and of the earliest versions of the Gospel, (the old
Latin, the Syriac, the Egyptian versions,) carry back our
evidence on this subject unmistakably to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the age immediately
succeeding that of the Apostles</span></em>. This will be found established
in the course of the ensuing Chapter.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Beginning our survey of the problem at the opposite end,
we arrive at the same result; with even a deepened conviction
that in its essential structure, the Lectionary of
the Eastern Church must be of truly primitive antiquity:
indeed that many of its leading provisions must date back
almost,‚Äînay <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite</span></em>,‚Äîto the Apostolic age. From whichever
side we approach this question,‚Äîwhatever test we are able
to apply to our premisses,‚Äîour conclusion remains still the
very same.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) Into this Lectionary then,‚Äîso universal in its extent,
so consistent in its witness, so Apostolic in its antiquity,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Last Twelve Verses</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the Gospel according to
S. Mark</span></em>‚Äù</span> from the very first are found to have won for
themselves not only an entrance, a lodgment, an established
place; but, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the place of highest honour</span></em>,‚Äîan audience on two
of the Church's chiefest Festivals.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The circumstance is far too important, far too significant
to be passed by without a few words of comment.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For it is not here, (be it carefully observed,) as when
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page210">[pg 210]</span><a name="Pg210" id="Pg210" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
we appeal to some Patristic citation, that the recognition of
a phrase, or a verse, or a couple of verses, must be accepted
as a proof that the same ancient Father recognised the
context also in which those words are found. Not so. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">All
the Twelve Verses in dispute are found in every known copy</span></em>
of the venerable Lectionary of the East. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Those same Twelve
Verses</span></em>,‚Äîneither more nor less,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">are observed to constitute
one integral Lection</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But even this is not all. The most important fact seems
to be that to these Verses has been assigned a place of the
highest possible distinction. It is found that, from the very
first, S. Mark xvi. 9-20 has been everywhere, and by all
branches of the Church Catholic, claimed for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> of the
Church's greatest Festivals,‚ÄîEaster and Ascension. A more
weighty or a more significant circumstance can scarcely be
imagined. To suppose that a portion of Scripture singled
out for such extraordinary honour by the Church universal
is a spurious addition to the Gospel, is purely irrational; is
simply monstrous. No unauthorized <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfragment,‚Äù</span> however
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúremarkable,‚Äù</span> could by possibility have so established itself
in the regards of the East and of the West, from the very
first. No suspected <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaddition, placed here in very early
times,‚Äù</span> would have been tolerated in the Church's solemn
public Service six or seven times a-year. No. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It is impossible.</span></em>
Had it been one short clause which we were invited
to surrender: a verse: two verses: even three or four:‚Äîthe
plea being that (as in the case of the celebrated <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pericopa
de adulter√¢</span></span>) the Lectionaries knew nothing of them:‚Äîthe
case would have been entirely different. But for any one
to seek to persuade us that these Twelve Verses, which
exactly constitute one of the Church's most famous Lections,
are every one of them spurious:‚Äîthat the fatal taint begins
with the first verse, and only ends with the last:‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> is
a demand on our simplicity which, in a less solemn subject,
would only provoke a smile. We are constrained to testify
astonishment and even some measure of concern. Have the
Critics then, (supposing them to be familiar with the evidence
which has now been set forth so much in detail;)‚ÄîHave
the Critics then, (we ask) utterly taken leave of their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page211">[pg 211]</span><a name="Pg211" id="Pg211" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
senses? or do they really suppose that we have taken leave
of ours?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is time to close this discussion. It was declared at the
outset that the witness of the Lectionaries to the genuineness
of these Verses, though it has been generally overlooked,
is the most important of any: admitting, as it does, of no
evasion: being simply, as it is, decisive. I have now fully
explained the grounds of that assertion. I have set the
Verses, which I undertook to vindicate and establish, on
a basis from which it will be found impossible any more
to dislodge them. Whatever Griesbach, and Tischendorf,
and Tregelles, and the rest, may think about the matter,‚Äîthe
Holy Eastern Church in her corporate capacity, has
never been of their opinion. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">They</span></em> may doubt. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The ante-Nicene
Fathers</span></em> at least never doubted. If <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last Twelve
Verses‚Äù</span> of S. Mark were <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deservedly</span></em> omitted from certain
Copies of his Gospel in the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,
utterly incredible is it that these same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Twelve Verses</span></span>
should have been disseminated, by their authority, throughout Christendom;‚Äîread,
by their command, in all the Churches;‚Äîselected, by
their collective judgment, from the whole body of Scripture
for the special honour of being listened to once and again
at <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Easter</span></span> time, as well as on

I am much mistaken if the suggestion which I am about
to offer has not already presented itself to every reader of
ordinary intelligence who has taken the trouble to follow
the course of my argument thus far with attention. It requires
no acuteness whatever,‚Äîit is, as it seems to me, the
merest instinct of mother-wit,‚Äîon reaching the present
stage of the discussion, to debate with oneself somewhat as
follows:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. So then, the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel
were anciently often observed to be missing from the copies.
Eusebius expressly says so. I observe that he nowhere says
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">their genuineness</span></em> was anciently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suspected</span></em>. As for himself,
his elaborate discussion of their contents convinces me
that individually, he regarded them with favour. The mere
fact,‚Äî(it is best to keep to his actual statement,)‚Äîthat
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe entire passage‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_393" name="noteref_393" href="#note_393"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">393</span></span></a> was <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúnot met with
in all the copies,‚Äù</span> is the sum of his evidence: and two Greek manuscripts, yet
extant, supposed to be of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century
(Codd. B and ◊ê), mutilated in this precise way, testify to the truth of his
statement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. But then it is found that these self-same Twelve Verses,‚Äîneither
more nor less,‚Äîanciently constituted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an integral
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page213">[pg 213]</span><a name="Pg213" id="Pg213" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
Ecclesiastical Lection</span></em>; which lection,‚Äîinasmuch as it is found
to have established itself in every part of Christendom at
the earliest period to which liturgical evidence reaches back,
and to have been assigned from the very first to two of the
chiefest Church Festivals,‚Äîmust needs be a lection of almost
Apostolic antiquity. Eusebius, I observe, (see p. <a href="#Pg045" class="tei tei-ref">45</a>),
designates the portion of Scripture in dispute by its technical
name,‚ÄîŒ∫ŒµœÜ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ or œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄ·Ωµ; (for so an Ecclesiastical lection
was anciently called). Here then is a rare coincidence
indeed. It is in fact simply unique. Surely, I may add
that it is in the highest degree suggestive also. It inevitably
provokes the inquiry,‚ÄîMust not these two facts be not only
connected, but even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">interdependent</span></em>? Will not the omission
of the Twelve concluding Verses of S. Mark from certain
ancient copies of his Gospel, have been in some way <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">occasioned
by the fact</span></em> that those same twelve verses constituted an
integral Church Lection? How is it possible to avoid suspecting
that the phenomenon to which Eusebius invites
attention, (viz. that certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel in very
ancient times had been mutilated from the end of the 8th
verse onwards,) ought to be capable of illustration,‚Äîwill
have in fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to be explained</span></em>, and in a word <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accounted
for</span></em>,‚Äîby the circumstance that at the 8th verse of S. Mark's
xvi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> chapter, one ancient Lection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">came
to an end</span></em>, and another ancient Lection <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">began</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Somewhat thus, (I venture to think,) must every unprejudiced
Reader of intelligence hold parley with himself on
reaching the close of the preceding chapter. I need hardly
add that I am thoroughly convinced he would be reasoning
rightly. I am going to shew that the Lectionary practice
of the ancient Church does indeed furnish a sufficient clue
for the unravelment of this now famous problem: in other
words, enables us satisfactorily to account for the omission
of these Twelve Verses from ancient copies of the collected
Gospels. But I mean to do more. I propose to make my
appeal to documents which shall be observed to bear no
faltering witness in my favour. More yet. I propose that
Eusebius himself, the chief author of all this trouble, shall
be brought back into Court and invited to resyllable his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page214">[pg 214]</span><a name="Pg214" id="Pg214" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Evidence; and I am much mistaken if even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he</span></em> will not be
observed to let fall a hint that we have at last got on the
right scent;‚Äîhave accurately divined how this mistake
took its first beginning;‚Äîand, (what is not least to the
purpose,) have correctly apprehended what was his own real
meaning in what he himself has said.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The proposed solution of the difficulty,‚Äîif not the evidence
on which it immediately rests,‚Äîmight no doubt be
exhibited within exceedingly narrow limits. Set down
abruptly, however, its weight and value would inevitably
fail to be recognised, even by those who already enjoy some
familiarity with these studies. Very few of the considerations
which I shall have to rehearse are in fact unknown
to Critics: yet is it evident that their bearing on the problem
before us has hitherto altogether escaped their notice.
On the other hand, by one entirely a novice to this department
of sacred Science, I could scarcely hope to be so much
as understood. Let me be allowed, therefore, to preface what
I have to say with a few explanatory details which I promise
shall not be tedious, and which I trust will not be
found altogether without interest either. If they are anywhere
else to be met with, it is my misfortune, not my fault,
that I have been hitherto unsuccessful in discovering the place.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. From the earliest ages of the Church, (as I shewed
at page <a href="#Pg192" class="tei tei-ref">192-5</a>,) it has been customary to read certain
definite portions of Holy Scripture, determined by Ecclesiastical
authority, publicly before the Congregation. In
process of time, as was natural, the sections so required for
public use were collected into separate volumes: Lections
from the Gospels being written out in a Book which was
called <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Evangelistarium</span></span>,‚Äù</span> (Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπœÉœÑ·Ω±œÅŒπŒøŒΩ,)‚Äîfrom
the Acts and Epistles, in a book called <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Praxapostolus</span></span>,‚Äù</span>
(œÄœÅŒ±ŒæŒ±œÄ·ΩπœÉœÑŒøŒªŒøœÇ). These Lectionary-books, both Greek and Syriac,
are yet extant in great numbers,<a id="noteref_394" name="noteref_394" href="#note_394"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">394</span></span></a>
and (I may remark in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page215">[pg 215]</span><a name="Pg215" id="Pg215" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
passing) deserve a far greater amount of attention than has
hitherto been bestowed upon them.<a id="noteref_395" name="noteref_395" href="#note_395"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">395</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">When</span></em> the Lectionary first took the form of a separate
book, has not been ascertained. That no copy is known to
exist (whether in Greek or in Syriac) older than the
viii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century, proves nothing. Codices in daily use, (like the
Bibles used in our Churches,) must of necessity have been
of exceptionally brief duration; and Lectionaries, more even
than Biblical MSS. were liable to injury and decay.

II. But it is to be observed,‚Äî(and to explain this, is much
more to my present purpose,)‚Äîthat besides transcribing the
Ecclesiastical lections into separate books, it became the
practice at a very early period <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to adapt copies of the Gospel
to lectionary purposes</span></em>. I suspect that this practice began in
the Churches of Syria; for Syriac copies of the Gospels (<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at
least</span></em> of the vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century) abound,
which have the Lections more or less systematically rubricated in the
Text.<a id="noteref_396" name="noteref_396" href="#note_396"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">396</span></span></a> There
is in the British Museum a copy of S. Mark's Gospel according

in all later cursive Greek MSS., (I mean those of the
xii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> to the
xv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,) the
Ecclesiastical lections are indicated throughout: while either
at the summit, or else at the foot of the page, the formula
with which the Lection was to be introduced is elaborately
inserted; prefaced probably by a rubricated statement (not
always very easy to decipher) of the occasion <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">when</span></em> the ensuing
portion of Scripture was to be read. The ancients, to
a far greater extent than ourselves,<a id="noteref_398" name="noteref_398" href="#note_398"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">398</span></span></a> were accustomed,‚Äî(in
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page216">[pg 216]</span><a name="Pg216" id="Pg216" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
fact, they made it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a rule</span></em>,)‚Äîto prefix unauthorized formul√¶
to their public Lections; and these are sometimes found
to have established themselves so firmly, that at last they
became as it were ineradicable; and later copyists of the
fourfold Gospel are observed to introduce them unsuspiciously
into the inspired text.<a id="noteref_399" name="noteref_399" href="#note_399"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">399</span></span></a> All that belongs to this

which the text of the New Testament has experienced.
We are made to understand how, what was originally intended
only as a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liturgical note</span></em>, became mistaken, through
the inadvertence or the stupidity of copyists, for a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">critical
suggestion</span></em>; and thus, besides transpositions without number,
there has arisen, at one time, the insertion of something unauthorized
into the text of Scripture,‚Äîat another, the omission
of certain inspired words, to the manifest detriment of
the sacred deposit. For although the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">systematic</span></em> rubrication of
the Gospels for liturgical purposes is a comparatively recent
invention,‚Äî(I question if it be older in Greek MSS. than
the x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,)‚Äîyet
will persons engaged in the public Services of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God's</span></span>
House have been prone, from the very earliest age, to insert memoranda of the
kind referred to, into the margin of their copies. In this way, in fact, it may
be regarded as certain that in countless minute particulars
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page217">[pg 217]</span><a name="Pg217" id="Pg217" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the text of Scripture has been depraved. Let me not fail to
add, that by a judicious, and above all by an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">unprejudiced</span></em>
use of the materials at our disposal, it may, even at this
distance of time, in every such particular, be successfully
restored.<a id="noteref_400" name="noteref_400" href="#note_400"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">400</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. I now proceed to shew, by an induction of instances,
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">even in the oldest copies in existence</span></em>, I mean in Codd. B,
◊ê, A, C, and D, the Lectionary system of the early Church
has left abiding traces of its operation. When a few such
undeniable cases have been adduced, all objections grounded
on <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prim√¢ facie</span></span> improbability will have been satisfactorily
disposed of. The activity, as well as the existence of such
a disturbing force and depraving influence, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least</span></em> as far
back as the beginning of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, (but
it is in fact more ancient by full two hundred years,) will have been
established: of which I shall only have to shew, in conclusion,
that the omission of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last Twelve Verses‚Äù</span> of
S. Mark's Gospel is probably but one more instance,‚Äîthough
confessedly by far the most extraordinary of any.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) From Codex B then, as well as from Cod. A, the two
grand verses which describe our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAgony and Bloody
Sweat,‚Äù</span> (S. Luke xxii. 43, 44,) are missing. The same two
verses are absent also from a few other important MSS., as
well as from both the Egyptian versions; but I desire to fasten
attention on the confessedly erring testimony in this place
of Codex B. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúConfessedly erring,‚Äù</span> I say; for the genuineness
of those two verses is no longer disputed. Now, in
every known Evangelistarium, the two verses here omitted
by Cod. B follow, (the Church so willed it,) S. Matth. xxvi.
39, and are read as a regular part of the lesson for the
Thursday in Holy Week.<a id="noteref_401" name="noteref_401" href="#note_401"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">401</span></span></a> Of course they are also
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omitted</span></em> in the same Evangelistaria from the lesson for the Tuesday
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page218">[pg 218]</span><a name="Pg218" id="Pg218" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
after Sexagesima, (œÑ·øá Œ≥·æΩ œÑ·øÜœÇ œÑœÖœÅŒøœÜ·Ω±Œ≥ŒøœÖ, as the Easterns call
that day,) when S. Luke xxii. 39-xxiii. 1 used to be read.
Moreover, in all ancient copies of the Gospels which have
been accommodated to ecclesiastical use, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the reader of S. Luke
xxii. is invariably directed by a marginal note to leave out those
two verses</span></em>, and to proceed per saltum from ver. 42 to ver.
45.<a id="noteref_402" name="noteref_402" href="#note_402"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">402</span></span></a>
What more obvious therefore than that the removal of the
paragraph from its proper place in S. Luke's Gospel is to be
attributed to nothing else but the Lectionary practice of the
primitive Church? Quite unreasonable is it to impute heretical
motives, or to invent any other unsupported theory,
while this plain solution of the difficulty is at hand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) The same Cod. B., (with which Codd. ◊ê, C, L, U and Œì
are observed here to conspire,) introduces the piercing of the
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> side (S. John xix. 34) at the end of S. Matth.
xxvii. 49. Now, I only do not insist that this must needs
be the result of the singular Lectionary practice already described
at p. 202, because a scholion in Cod. 72 records the
singular fact that in the Diatessaron of Tatian, after S. Matth.
xxvii. 48, was read ·ºÑŒªŒªŒøœÇ Œ¥·Ω≤ ŒªŒ±Œ≤·ΩºŒΩ Œª·ΩπŒ≥œáŒ∑ŒΩ ·ºîŒΩœÖŒæŒµŒΩ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶ œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ

evidently vitiated in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">precisely</span></em> the same way.) This interpolation
therefore may have resulted from the corrupting influence
of Tatian's (so-called) <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHarmony.‚Äù</span> See <a href="#Appendix_H" class="tei tei-ref">Appendix (H)</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) To keep on safe ground. Codd. B and D concur in what
Alford justly calls the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgrave error‚Äù</span> of simply omitting
from S. Luke xxiii. 34, our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> supplication on behalf of
His murderers, (·ΩÅ Œ¥·Ω≤ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ ·ºîŒªŒµŒ≥Œµ, Œ†·Ω±œÑŒµœÅ, ·ºÑœÜŒµœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·øñœÇ: Œø·Ωê
Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ Œø·º¥Œ¥Œ±œÉŒπ œÑ·Ω∑ œÄŒøŒπŒø·ø¶œÉŒπ). They are not quite singular in so
doing; being, as usual, kept in countenance by certain
copies of the old Latin, as well as by both the Egyptian
versions. How is this <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgrave error‚Äù</span> in so many ancient
MSS. to be accounted for? (for a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúgrave error‚Äù</span> or rather
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa fatal omission‚Äù</span> it certainly is). Simply by the fact that
in the Eastern Church the Lection for the Thursday after
Sexagesima <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">breaks off abruptly, immediately before these very
words</span></em>,‚Äîto recommence at ver. 44.<a id="noteref_403" name="noteref_403" href="#note_403"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">403</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) Note, that at ver. 32, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the eighth </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúGospel of the Passion‚Äù</span><span style="font-style: italic">
begins</span></em>,‚Äîwhich is the reason why Codd. B and ◊ê (with
the Egyptian versions) exhibit a singular irregularity in
that place; and why the Jerusalem Syriac introduces the
established formula of the Lectionaries (œÉ·Ω∫ŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶) at
the same juncture.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(If I do not here insist that the absence of the famous
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">pericopa de adulter√¢</span></span> (S. John vii. 53-viii. 11,) from so
many MSS., is to be explained in precisely the same way, it
is only because the genuineness of that portion of the Gospel
is generally denied; and I propose, in this enumeration
of instances, not to set foot on disputed ground. I am convinced,
nevertheless, that the first occasion of the omission
of those memorable verses was the lectionary practice of the
primitive Church, which, on Whitsunday, read from S. John
vii. 37 to viii. 12, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">leaving out the twelve verses</span></em> in question.
Those verses, from the nature of their contents, (as Augustine
declares,) easily came to be viewed with dislike or suspicion.
The passage, however, is as old as the second century,
for it is found in certain copies of the old Latin. Moreover
Jerome deliberately gave it a place in the Vulgate. I pass on.)

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page220">[pg 220]</span><a name="Pg220" id="Pg220" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5.) The two oldest Codices in existence,‚ÄîB and ◊ê,‚Äîstand
all but alone in omitting from S. Luke vi. 1 the unique
and indubitably genuine word Œ¥ŒµœÖœÑŒµœÅŒøœÄœÅ·ΩΩœÑ·ø≥; which is also
omitted by the Peshito, Italic and Coptic versions. And
yet, when it is observed that an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical lection begins
here</span></em>, and that the Evangelistaria (which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> leave out
such notes of time) simply drop the word,‚Äîonly substituting
for ·ºêŒΩ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑ·ø≥ the more familiar œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπ,‚Äîevery one
will be ready to admit that if the omission of this word be
not due to the inattention of the copyist, (which, however,
seems to me not at all unlikely,<a id="noteref_404" name="noteref_404" href="#note_404"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">404</span></span></a>) it is sufficiently explained
by the Lectionary practice of the Church,‚Äîwhich may well
date back even to the immediately post-Apostolic age.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6.) In S. Luke xvi. 19, Cod. D introduces the Parable of
Lazarus with the formula,‚ÄîŒµ·º∂œÄŒµŒΩ Œ¥·Ω≤ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºëœÑ·Ω≥œÅŒ±ŒΩ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ≤ŒøŒª·ΩµŒΩ;

of the Vulgate and of the old Latin Version. Indeed, it may be
stated generally concerning the text of Cod. D, that it bears
marks <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">throughout</span></em> of the depraving influence of the ancient
Lectionary practice. Instances of this, (in addition to those
elsewhere cited in these pages,) will be discovered in S. Luke
iii. 23: iv. 16 (and xix. 45): v. 1 and 17: vi. 37 (and xviii.
15): vii. 1: x. 1 and 25: xx. 1: in all but three of which,
Cod. D is kept in countenance by the old Latin, often by the
Syriac, and by other versions of the greatest antiquity. But
to proceed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(8.) Cod. A, (supported by Athanasius, the Vulgate,
Gothic, and Philoxenian versions,) for Œ∫Œ±·Ω∑, in S. Luke ix. 57,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page221">[pg 221]</span><a name="Pg221" id="Pg221" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
reads ·ºêŒ≥·Ω≥ŒΩŒµœÑŒø Œ¥·Ω≤,‚Äîwhich is the reading of the Textus Receptus.
Cod. D, (with some copies of the old Latin,) exhibits
Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ ·ºêŒ≥·Ω≥ŒΩŒµœÑŒø. All the diversity which is observable in this
place, (and it is considerable,) is owing to the fact that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an Ecclesiastical lection begins here</span></em>.<a id="noteref_408" name="noteref_408" href="#note_408"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">408</span></span></a> In different Churches,
the formula with which the lection was introduced slightly
differed.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(9.) Cod. C is supported by Chrysostom and Jerome, as
well as by the Peshito, Cureton's and the Philoxenian Syriac,
and some MSS. of the old Latin, in reading ·ΩÅ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ at the
beginning of S. Matth. xi. 20. That the words have no business
there, is universally admitted. So also is the cause of
their interpolation generally recognized. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Ecclesiastical
lection</span></em> for Wednesday in the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
week after Pentecost <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">begins at that place</span></em>; and begins with the
formula,‚Äî·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∑œÅ·ø≥ ·ºêŒ∫ŒµŒπŒΩ·ø≥, ·º§œÅŒæŒ±œÑŒø ·ΩÅ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ ·ΩÄŒΩŒµŒπŒ¥·Ω∑Œ∂ŒµŒπŒΩ.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(10.) Similarly, in S. Matth. xii. 9, xiii. 36, and xiv. 14,
Cod. C inserts ·ΩÅ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ; a reading which on all three occasions
is countenanced by the Syriac and some copies of the
old Latin, and on the last of the three, by Origen also. And
yet there can be no doubt that it is only because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical
lections begin at those places</span></em>,<a id="noteref_409" name="noteref_409" href="#note_409"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">409</span></span></a>
that the Holy Name is introduced there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(11.) Let me add that the Sacred Name is confessedly an
interpolation in the six places indicated at foot,‚Äîits presence
being accounted for by the fact that, in each, an <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical
lection begins</span></em>.<a id="noteref_410" name="noteref_410" href="#note_410"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">410</span></span></a> Cod. D in one of these places, Cod. A in
four, is kept in countenance by the old Latin, the Syriac, the
Coptic and other early versions;‚Äîconvincing indications of
the extent to which the Lectionary practice of the Church
had established itself so early as the second century of
our √¶ra.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Cod. D, and copies of the old Latin and Egyptian versions
also read œÑŒø·ø¶ ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶, (instead of Œ±·ΩêœÑŒø·ø¶,) in S. Mark
xiv. 3; which is only because <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a Church lesson begins there</span></em>.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page222">[pg 222]</span><a name="Pg222" id="Pg222" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(12.) The same Cod. D is all but unique in leaving out
that memorable verse in S. Luke's Gospel (xxiv. 12), in
which S. Peter's visit to the Sepulchre of our risen <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>
finds particular mention. It is only because that verse was
claimed both as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">conclusion</span></em> of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> and also as the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">beginning</span></em> of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
Gospel of the Resurrection: so that the
liturgical note ·ºÄœÅœá·Ωµ stands at the beginning,‚ÄîœÑ·Ω≥ŒªŒøœÇ at the
end of it. Accordingly, D is kept in countenance here only
by the Jerusalem Lectionary and some copies of the old
Latin. But what is to be thought of the editorial judgment
which (with Tregelles) encloses this verse within brackets;
and (with Tischendorf) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rejects it from the text altogether</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(13.) Codices B, ◊ê, and D are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">alone</span></em> among MSS. in omitting
the clause Œ¥ŒπŒµŒªŒ∏·ΩºŒΩ Œ¥Œπ·Ω∞ Œº·Ω≥œÉŒøœÖ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ: Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂ œÄŒ±œÅ·øÜŒ≥ŒµŒΩ Œø·ΩîœÑœâœÇ,
at the end of the 59th verse of S. John viii. The omission
is to be accounted for by the fact that just <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> the Church-lesson
for Tuesday in the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> week after Easter

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(14.) Again. It is not at all an unusual thing to find
in cursive MSS., at the end of S. Matth. viii. 13, (with several
varieties), the spurious and tasteless appendix,‚ÄîŒ∫Œ±·Ω∂

But it is not only in cursive MSS. that these words are
found. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">They are met with also in the Codex Sinaiticus</span></em> (◊ê):
a witness at once to the inveteracy of Liturgical usage in

and to the corruptions which the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCodex omnium antiquissimus‚Äù</span>

(15.) In conclusion, I may remark generally that there
occur instances, again and again, of perturbations of the
Text in our oldest MSS., (corresponding sometimes with
readings vouched for by the most ancient of the Fathers,)
which admit of no more intelligible or inoffensive solution
than by referring them to the Lectionary practice of the
primitive Church.<a id="noteref_412" name="noteref_412" href="#note_412"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">412</span></span></a>

exercised a depraving influence of a peculiar kind on the
text of Scripture. Further yet, (and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> is the only point
I am now concerned to establish), that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">our five oldest Copies
of the Gospels</span></span>,‚ÄîB and ◊ê as well as A, C and D,‚Äîexhibit
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page224">[pg 224]</span><a name="Pg224" id="Pg224" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
not a few traces of the mischievous agency alluded to;
errors, and especially <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">omissions</span></em>, which sometimes seriously
affect the character of those Codices as witnesses to the
Truth of Scripture.‚ÄîI proceed now to consider the case of
S. Mark xvi. 9-20; only prefacing my remarks with a few
necessary words of explanation.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
V. He who takes into his hands an ordinary cursive MS.
of the Gospels, is prepared to find the Church-lessons regularly
indicated throughout, in the text or in the margin.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A familiar contraction, executed probably in vermillion [œá over Œ±œÅ],
·ºÄœÅ, indicates the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbeginning‚Äù</span> (·ºÄœÅœá·Ωµ) of each lection: a corresponding
contraction (Œµ over œÑ, œÑŒµ, œÑŒµŒª), indicates its <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúend‚Äù</span>
(œÑ·Ω≥ŒªŒøœÉ.) Generally, these rubrical directions, (for they are
nothing else,) are inserted for convenience into the body of
the text,‚Äîfrom which the red pigment with which they are
almost invariably executed, effectually distinguishes them.
But all these particulars gradually disappear as recourse is
had to older and yet older MSS. The studious in such
matters have noticed that even the memorandums as to the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbeginning‚Äù</span> and the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúend‚Äù</span> of a lection are rare, almost
in proportion to the antiquity of a Codex. When they do
occur in the later uncials, they do not by any means always
seem to have been the work of the original scribe; neither
has care been always taken to indicate them in ink of
a different colour. It will further be observed in such MSS.
that whereas the sign where the reader is to begin is generally‚Äî(in
order the better to attract his attention,)‚Äîinserted
in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the margin</span></em> of the Codex, the note where he is to
leave off, (in order the more effectually to arrest his progress,)
is as a rule introduced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">into the body of the text</span></em>.<a id="noteref_415" name="noteref_415" href="#note_415"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">415</span></span></a> In
uncial MSS., however, all such symbols are not only rare,
but (what is much to be noted) they are exceedingly irregular
in their occurrence. Thus in Codex Œì, in the Bodleian
Library, (a recently acquired uncial MS. of the Gospels,
written <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 844), there occurs no indication of the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúend‚Äù</span> of a single lection in S. Luke's Gospel, until chap.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page225">[pg 225]</span><a name="Pg225" id="Pg225" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
xvi. 31 is reached; after which, the sign abounds. In Codex
L, the original notes of Ecclesiastical Lections occur at the
following rare and irregular intervals:‚ÄîS. Mark ix. 2:
x. 46: xii. 40 (where the sign has lost its way; it should
have stood against ver. 44): xv. 42 and xvi. 1.<a id="noteref_416" name="noteref_416" href="#note_416"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">416</span></span></a> In the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oldest</span></em> uncials, nothing of the kind is discoverable. Even in
the Codex Bez√¶, (vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,) not
a single liturgical direction <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">coeval with the MS.</span></em> is anywhere to be found.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VI. And yet, although the practice of thus indicating the
beginning and the end of a liturgical section, does not seem
to have come into general use until about the
xii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century;
and although, previous to the ix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century, systematic liturgical directions are probably unknown;<a id="noteref_417" name="noteref_417" href="#note_417"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">417</span></span></a> the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">need</span></em>
of them must have been experienced by one standing up to read before
the congregation, long before. The want of some reminder
where he was to begin,‚Äîabove all, of some hint
where he was to leave off,‚Äîwill have infallibly made itself
felt from the first. Accordingly, there are not wanting indications
that, occasionally, Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ (or Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£) was written
in the margin of Copies of the Gospels at an exceedingly
remote epoch. One memorable example of this practice is
supplied by the Codex Bez√¶ (D): where in S. Mark xiv. 41,
instead of ·ºÄœÄ·Ω≥œáŒµŒπ ·º¶ŒªŒ∏ŒµŒΩ ·º° ·Ω§œÅŒ±,‚Äîwe meet with the unintelligible
ŒëŒ†ŒïŒßŒïŒô Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ ŒöŒëŒô Œó Œ©Œ°Œë. Now, nothing
else has here happened but that a marginal note, designed
originally to indicate the end (Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£) of the lesson for
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page226">[pg 226]</span><a name="Pg226" id="Pg226" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the third day of the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span> week
of the Carnival, has lost its way from the end of ver. 42, and got thrust into the text
of ver. 41,‚Äîto the manifest destruction of the sense.<a id="noteref_418" name="noteref_418" href="#note_418"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">418</span></span></a> I find D's error here is shared (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) by
the Peshito Syriac, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) by the old Latin,
and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) by the Philoxenian: venerable partners
in error, truly! for the first two probably carry back
this false reading to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the second century of our √¶ra</span></em>; and so,
furnish one more remarkable proof, to be added to the fifteen
(or rather the forty) already enumerated (pp. <a href="#Pg217" class="tei tei-ref">217-23</a>), that
the lessons of the Eastern Church were settled at a period long
anterior to the date of the oldest MS. of the Gospels extant.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VII. Returning then to the problem before us, I venture
to suggest as follows:‚ÄîWhat if, at a very remote period,
this same isolated liturgical note (Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£) occurring at
S. Mark xvi. 8, (which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe end‚Äù</span> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Church-lection</span></em>
for the ii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span> Sunday after Easter,) should have
unhappily suggested to some copyist,‚ÄîŒ∫Œ±ŒªŒªŒπŒ≥œÅŒ±œÜ·Ω∑Œ±œÇ <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">quam vel
Critic√¶ Sacr√¶ vel rerum Liturgicarum peritior</span></span>,‚Äîthe notion that the
entire <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Gospel according to S. Mark</span></em>,‚Äù</span> came to an end at
verse 8?... I see no more probable account of the matter,
I say, than this:‚ÄîThat the mutilation of the last chapter
of S. Mark has resulted from the fact, that some very ancient
scribe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">misapprehended the import of the solitary liturgical note</span></em>
Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ (or Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£) which he found at the close of verse 8.
True, that he will have probably beheld, further on, several
additional œÉœÑ·Ω∑œáŒøŒπ. But if he did, how could he acknowledge
the fact more loyally than by leaving (as the author
of Cod. B is observed to have done) one entire column blank,
before proceeding with S. Luke? He hesitated, all the same,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page227">[pg 227]</span><a name="Pg227" id="Pg227" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to transcribe</span></em> any further, having before him, (as he thought,)
an assurance that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the end</span></span>‚Äù</span> had been reached at ver. 8.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
VIII. That some were found in very early times eagerly
to acquiesce in this omission: to sanction it: even to multiply
copies of the Gospel so mutilated; (critics or commentators
intent on nothing so much as reconciling the apparent
discrepancies in the Evangelical narratives:)‚Äîappears to
me not at all unlikely.<a id="noteref_419" name="noteref_419" href="#note_419"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">419</span></span></a> Eusebius almost says as much, when
he puts into the mouth of one who is for getting rid of
these verses altogether, the remark that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthey would be in
a manner superfluous <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">if it should appear that their testimony
is at variance with that of the other Evangelists</span></em>.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_420" name="noteref_420" href="#note_420"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">420</span></span></a> (The
ancients were giants in Divinity but children in Criticism.) On the
other hand, I altogether agree with Dean Alford in thinking
it highly improbable that the difficulty of harmonizing one
Gospel with another in this place, (such as it is,) was the
cause why these Twelve Verses were originally suppressed.<a id="noteref_421" name="noteref_421" href="#note_421"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">421</span></span></a>
(1) First, because there really was no need to withhold more
than three,‚Äîat the utmost, five of them,‚Äîif <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> had been
the reason of the omission. (2) Next, because it would have
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page228">[pg 228]</span><a name="Pg228" id="Pg228" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
been easier far to introduce some critical correction of any
supposed discrepancy, than to sweep away the whole of the
unoffending context. (3) Lastly, because nothing clearly
was gained by causing the Gospel to end so abruptly that
every one must see at a glance that it had been mutilated.
No. The omission having originated in a mistake, was perpetuated
for a brief period (let us suppose) only through
infirmity of judgment: or, (as I prefer to believe), only in
consequence of the religious fidelity of copyists, who were
evidently always instructed to transcribe exactly what they
found in the copy set before them. The Church meanwhile
in her corporate capacity, has never known anything at all
of the matter,‚Äîas was fully shewn above in <a href="#Chapter_X" class="tei tei-ref">Chap. X.</a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IX. When this solution of the problem first occurred to
me, (and it occurred to me long before I was aware of the
memorable reading Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ in the Codex Bez√¶, already
adverted to,) I reasoned with myself as follows:‚ÄîBut if the
mutilation of the second Gospel came about in this particular
way, the MSS. are bound to remember <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">something</span></em> of the
circumstance; and in ancient MSS., if I am right, I ought
certainly to meet with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> confirmation of my opinion.
According to my view, at the root of this whole matter lies
the fact that at S. Mark xvi. 8 a well-known Ecclesiastical
lesson comes to an end. Is there not perhaps something
exceptional in the way that the close of that liturgical
section was anciently signified?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
X. In order to ascertain this, I proceeded to inspect every
copy of the Gospels in the Imperial Library at Paris;<a id="noteref_422" name="noteref_422" href="#note_422"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">422</span></span></a> and
devoted seventy hours exactly, with unflagging delight, to
the task. The success of the experiment astonished me.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. I began with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Cod. 24 ( = Reg. 178) of the Gospels:
turned to the last page of S. Mark: and beheld, in a Codex
of the xi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Century wholly
devoid of the Lectionary apparatus
which is sometimes found in MSS. of a similar
date,<a id="noteref_423" name="noteref_423" href="#note_423"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">423</span></span></a>
at fol. 104, the word + Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ + conspicuously written
by the original scribe immediately after S. Mark xvi. 8, as
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page229">[pg 229]</span><a name="Pg229" id="Pg229" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
well as at the close of the Gospel. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">It occurred besides only
at ch.</span></em> ix. 9, (the end of the lesson for the Transfiguration.)
And yet there are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at least seventy</span></em> occasions in the course
of S. Mark's Gospel where, in MSS. which have been accommodated
to Church use, it is usual to indicate the close
of a Lection. This discovery, which surprised me not a little,
convinced me that I was on the right scent; and every hour
I met with some fresh confirmation of the fact.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. For the intelligent reader will readily understand that
three such deliberate liturgical memoranda, occurring solitary
in a MS. of this date, are to be accounted for only in
one way. They infallibly represent a corresponding peculiarity
in some far more ancient document. The fact that
the word Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ is here (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) set down unabbreviated,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) in black ink, and (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>)
as part of the text,‚Äîpoints unmistakably
in the same direction. But that Cod. 24 is derived from
a Codex of much older date is rendered certain by a circumstance
which shall be specified at foot.<a id="noteref_424" name="noteref_424" href="#note_424"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">424</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. The very same phenomena reappear in Cod. 36.<a id="noteref_425" name="noteref_425" href="#note_425"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">425</span></span></a> The
sign + Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ +, (which occurs punctually at S. Mark xvi. 8
and again at v. 20,) is found besides in S. Mark's Gospel
only at chap. i. 8;<a id="noteref_426" name="noteref_426" href="#note_426"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">426</span></span></a> at chap. xiv. 31; and (+ Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ Œ§ŒüŒ•
ŒöŒïŒ¶ŒëŒõ) at chap. xv. 24;‚Äîbeing on every occasion incorporated
with the Text. Now, when it is perceived that in
the second and third of these places, Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ has clearly lost
its way,‚Äîappearing where <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> Ecclesiastical lection came to
an end,‚Äîit will be felt that the MS. before us (of the
xi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century) if it was not actually
transcribed from,‚Äîmust at least exhibit at second hand,‚Äîa far
more ancient Codex.<a id="noteref_427" name="noteref_427" href="#note_427"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">427</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page230">[pg 230]</span><a name="Pg230" id="Pg230" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Only once more.‚ÄîCodex 22 ( = Reg. 72) was never
prepared for Church purposes. A rough hand has indeed
scrawled indications of the beginnings and endings of a few
of the Lessons, here and there; but these liturgical notes
are no part of the original MS. At S. Mark xvi. 8, however,
we are presented (as before) with the solitary note
+ Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ +‚Äî, incorporated with the text. Immediately after
which, (in writing of the same size,) comes a memorable
statement<a id="noteref_428" name="noteref_428" href="#note_428"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">428</span></span></a> in red letters. The whole stands thus:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Œ¶ŒüŒíŒüŒ•ŒùŒ§Œü ŒìŒëŒ° + Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ +‚Äî<br />
[cross] ŒïŒù Œ§ŒôŒ£Œô Œ§Œ©Œù ŒëŒùŒ§ŒôŒìŒ°ŒëŒ¶Œ©Œù.<br />
ŒïŒ©Œ£ Œ©ŒîŒï Œ†ŒõŒóŒ°ŒüŒ•Œ§ŒëŒô Œü ŒïŒ•<br />
ŒëŒìŒìŒïŒõŒôŒ£Œ§ŒóŒ£: ŒïŒù Œ†ŒüŒõŒõŒüŒôŒ£<br />
ŒîŒï. ŒöŒëŒô Œ§ŒëŒ•Œ§Œë Œ¶ŒïŒ°ŒïŒ§ŒëŒô +‚Äî<br />
ŒëŒùŒëŒ£Œ§ŒëŒ£ ŒîŒï. Œ†Œ°ŒüŒô Œ†Œ°Œ©Œ§Œó Œ£ŒëŒíŒíŒëŒ§Œ©Œù.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And then follows the rest of the Gospel; at the end of
which, the sign + Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ + is again repeated,‚Äîwhich sign,
however, occurs <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nowhere else</span></em> in the MS. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nor at the end of any of
the other three Gospels</span></em>. A more opportune piece of evidence
could hardly have been invented. A statement so apt and
so significant was surely a thing rather to be wished than
to be hoped for. For here is the liturgical sign Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ not
only occurring in the wholly exceptional way of which we
have already seen examples, but actually followed by the
admission that <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn certain copies, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Evangelist proceeds no
further</span></em>.‚Äù</span> The two circumstances so brought together seem
exactly to bridge over the chasm between Codd. B and ◊ê on
the one hand,‚Äîand Codd. 24 and 36 on the other; and to
supply us with precisely the link of evidence which we require.
For observe:‚ÄîDuring the first six centuries of our
√¶ra, no single instance is known of a codex in which Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£
is written at the end of a Gospel. The subscription of
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page231">[pg 231]</span><a name="Pg231" id="Pg231" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
S. Mark for instance is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> either ŒöŒëŒ§Œë ŒúŒëŒ°ŒöŒüŒù,‚Äî(as
in B and ◊ê): or else ŒïŒ•ŒëŒìŒìŒïŒõŒôŒüŒù ŒöŒëŒ§Œë ŒúŒëŒ°ŒöŒüŒù,‚Äî(as
in A and C, and the other older uncials): <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">never</span></em> Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£.
But here is a Scribe who first copies the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liturgical</span></em> note Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£,‚Äîand
then volunteers the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">critical</span></em> observation that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin some
copies of S. Mark's Gospel the Evangelist proceeds no further!‚Äù</span>
A more extraordinary corroboration of the view
which I am endeavouring to recommend to the reader's
acceptance, I really cannot imagine. Why, the ancient
Copyist actually comes back, in order to assure me that
the suggestion which I have been already offering in explanation
of the difficulty, is the true one!
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. I am not about to abuse the reader's patience with
a prolonged enumeration of the many additional conspiring
circumstances,‚Äîinsignificant in themselves and confessedly
unimportant when considered singly, but of which the cumulative
force is unquestionably great,‚Äîwhich an examination
of 99 MSS. of the Gospels brought to light.<a id="noteref_429" name="noteref_429" href="#note_429"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">429</span></span></a> Enough
has been said already to shew,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) That it must have been a customary thing, at
a very remote age, to write the word Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ against S. Mark
xvi. 8, even when the same note was withheld from the
close of almost every other ecclesiastical lection in the
Gospel.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2ndly.) That this word, or rather note, which no doubt
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page232">[pg 232]</span><a name="Pg232" id="Pg232" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
was originally written as a liturgical memorandum in the
margin, became at a very early period incorporated with the
text; where, retaining neither its use nor its significancy, it
was liable to misconception, and may have easily come to be
fatally misunderstood.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And although these two facts certainly prove nothing in
and by themselves, yet, when brought close alongside of the
problem which has to be solved, their significancy becomes
immediately apparent: for,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3rdly.) As a matter of fact, there are found to have
existed before the time of Eusebius, copies of S. Mark's
Gospel which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em> come to an end at this very place. Now,
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Evangelist</span></em> left off there, no one can
believe.<a id="noteref_430" name="noteref_430" href="#note_430"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">430</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em>,
then, did <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Scribe</span></em> leave off? But the Reader is already
in possession of the reason why. A sufficient explanation of
the difficulty has been elicited from the very MSS. themselves.
And surely when, suspended to an old chest which
has been locked up for ages, a key is still hanging which
fits the lock exactly and enables men to open the chest with
ease, they are at liberty to assume that the key <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">belongs</span></em> to
the lock; is, in fact, the only instrument by which the chest
may lawfully be opened.

XI. And now, in conclusion, I propose that we summon
back our original Witness, and invite him to syllable his
evidence afresh, in order that we may ascertain if perchance
it affords any countenance whatever to the view which I have

record that copies of S. Mark's Gospel were anciently defective
from the 8th verse onwards <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> vestige may be discoverable
of the forgotten truth. Now, it has been already

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Surely, a new and unexpected light already begins to
dawn upon this subject! How is it that we paid so little
attention before to the terms in which this ancient Father
delivers his evidence, that we overlooked the import of an
expression of his which from the first must have struck us as
peculiar, but which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> we perceive to be of paramount significancy?
Eusebius is pointing out that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> way for a man
(so minded) to get rid of the apparent inconsistency between
S. Mark xvi. 9 and S. Matth. xxviii. 1, would be for him to
reject the entire <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEcclesiastical Lection‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_433" name="noteref_433" href="#note_433"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">433</span></span></a> in which S. Mark
xvi. 9 occurs. Any one adopting this course, (he proceeds;
and it is much to be noted that Eusebius is throughout delivering
the imaginary sentiments of another,‚Äînot his own:)
Such an one (he says) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwill say that it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not met with in all</span></em>
the copies of S. Mark's Gospel. The accurate copies, at all
events,‚Äù</span>‚Äîand then follows an expression in which this
ancient Critic is observed ingeniously to accommodate his
language to the phenomenon which he has to describe, so as
covertly to insinuate something else. Eusebius employs an
idiom (it is found elsewhere in his writings) sufficiently
colourless to have hitherto failed to arouse attention; but
of which it is impossible to overlook the actual design
and import, after all that has gone before. He clearly
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognises the very phenomenon to which I have been calling
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page234">[pg 234]</span><a name="Pg234" id="Pg234" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
attention</span></em> within the last two pages, and which I need not
further insist upon or explain: viz. that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the words</span></em> Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">were</span></em> in some very ancient (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the accurate</span></em>‚Äù</span>) copies
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">found written after</span></em> ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ: although to an unsuspicious reader
the expression which he uses may well seem to denote
nothing more than that the second Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">generally came
to an end</span></em> there.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. And now it is time to direct attention to the important
bearing of the foregoing remark on the main point at issue.
The true import of what Eusebius has delivered, and which
has at last been ascertained, will be observed really to set
his evidence in a novel and unsuspected light. From the
days of Jerome, it has been customary to assume that Eusebius
roundly states that, in his time <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost all the Greek
copies</span></em> were without our <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúlast Twelve Verses‚Äù</span> of S. Mark's
Gospel:<a id="noteref_434" name="noteref_434" href="#note_434"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">434</span></span></a>
whereas Eusebius really <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">does nowhere say so</span></em>. He
expresses himself enigmatically, resorting to a somewhat unusual
phrase<a id="noteref_435" name="noteref_435" href="#note_435"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">435</span></span></a> which perhaps admits of no exact English counterpart:
but what he says clearly amounts to no more than
this,‚Äîthat <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the accurate</span></em> copies, at the words ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ,
circumscribe <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the end</span></span> (Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£) of Mark's narrative:‚Äù</span> that
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin almost all the Copies of the Gospel according to
Mark, is circumscribed <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">the end</span></span>.‚Äù</span> He says no more. He
does not say that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis circumscribed <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Gospel</span></em>.‚Äù</span> As
for the twelve verses which follow, he merely declares that
they were <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not met with in all</span></em> the copies;‚Äù</span> i.e. that some
copies did not contain them. But this, so far from being
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page235">[pg 235]</span><a name="Pg235" id="Pg235" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
a startling statement, is no more than what Codd. B and ◊ê in
themselves are sufficient to establish. In other words, Eusebius,
(whose testimony on this subject as it is commonly
understood is so extravagant [see above, p. <a href="#Pg048" class="tei tei-ref">48-9</a>,] as to carry
with it its own sufficient refutation,) is found to bear consistent
testimony to the two following modest propositions;
which, however, are not adduced by him as reasons for rejecting
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, but only as samples of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what
might be urged</span></em> by one desirous of shelving a difficulty suggested
by their contents;‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) That from <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> ancient copies of S. Mark's Gospel
these last Twelve Verses were away.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2nd.) That in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">almost</span></em> all the copies,‚Äî(whether mutilated
or not, he does not state,)‚Äîthe words Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ were found
immediately after ver. 8; which, (he seems to hint,) let
those who please accept as evidence that there also is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the end
of the Gospel</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. But I cannot dismiss the testimony of Eusebius until
I have recorded my own entire conviction that this Father is
no more an original authority here than Jerome, or Hesychius,
or Victor.<a id="noteref_436" name="noteref_436" href="#note_436"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">436</span></span></a> He is evidently adopting the language of
some more ancient writer than himself. I observe that he
introduces the problem with the remark that what follows
is one of tho questions <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúfor ever mooted by every body.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_437" name="noteref_437" href="#note_437"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">437</span></span></a>
I suspect (with Matthaei, [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supr√†</span></span>, p.
<a href="#Pg066" class="tei tei-ref">66</a>,]) that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Origen</span></em> is the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">true</span></em> author of all this confusion. He certainly relates of himself
that among his voluminous exegetical writings was a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">treatise
on S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>.<a id="noteref_438" name="noteref_438" href="#note_438"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">438</span></span></a> To Origen's works, Eusebius, (his
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page236">[pg 236]</span><a name="Pg236" id="Pg236" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
apologist and admirer,) is known to have habitually resorted;
and, like many others, to have derived not a few
of his notions from that fervid and acute, but most erratic
intellect. Origen's writings in short, seem to have been
the source of much, if not most of the mistaken Criticism
of Antiquity. (The reader is reminded of what has been
offered above at p. <a href="#Pg096" class="tei tei-ref">96-7</a>). And this would not be the first
occasion on which it would appear that when an ancient
Writer speaks of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the accurate copies</span></em>‚Äù</span>, what he actually
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">means is the text of Scripture which was employed or approved
by Origen</span></em>.<a id="noteref_439" name="noteref_439" href="#note_439"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">439</span></span></a> The more attentively the language of Eusebius
in this place is considered, the more firmly (it is
thought) will the suspicion be entertained that he is here
only reproducing the sentiments of another person. But,
however this may be, it is at least certain that the precise
meaning of what he says, has been hitherto generally overlooked.
He certainly does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> say, as Jerome, from his
loose translation of the passage,<a id="noteref_440" name="noteref_440" href="#note_440"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">440</span></span></a> evidently
imagined,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">omnibus
</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page237">[pg 237]</span><a name="Pg237" id="Pg237" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">

but only,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">non in omnibus Evangelii exemplaribus hoc capitulum
inveniri</span></span>;‚Äù</span> which is an entirely different thing. Eusebius
adds,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAccuratiora saltem exemplaria <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">finem</span></span> narrationis
secundum Marcum circumscribunt in verbis ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø

secundum Marcum, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">finem</span></span> circumscribi.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîThe point,
however, of greatest interest is, that Eusebius here calls attention
to the prevalence in MSS. of his time of the very <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">liturgical
peculiarity</span></em> which plainly supplies the one true solution of
the problem under discussion. His testimony is a marvellous
corroboration of what we learn from Cod. 22, (see
above, p. <a href="#Pg230" class="tei tei-ref">230</a>,) and, rightly understood, does not go a whit
beyond it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
5. What wonder that Hesychius, because he adopted
blindly what he found in Eusebius, should at once betray
his author and exactly miss the point of what his author
says? Œ§·Ω∏ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ Œú·Ω±œÅŒ∫ŒøŒΩ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥·Ω≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ (so he writes) Œº·Ω≥œáœÅŒπ œÑŒø·ø¶

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
6. This may suffice concerning the testimony of Eusebius.‚ÄîIt
will be understood that I suppose Origen to have fallen
in with one or more copies of S. Mark's Gospel which exhibited
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Liturgical hint</span></em>, (Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£,) conspicuously written
against S. Mark xvi. 9. Such a copy may, or may not,
have there terminated abruptly. I suspect however that it
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em>. Origen at all events, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">more suo</span></span>,) will have
remarked on the phenomenon before him; and Eusebius will have
adopted his remarks,‚Äîas the heralds say, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwith <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a
difference</span></em>‚Äù</span>‚Äîsimply because they suited his purpose, and seemed
to him ingenious and interesting.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
7. For the copy in question,‚Äî(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">like</span></em> that other copy of
S. Mark from which the Peshito translation was made, and
in which Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ most inopportunely occurs at chap. xiv.

have become the progenitor of several other
copies (as Codd. B and ◊ê); and some of these, it is pretty
evident, were familiarly known to Eusebius.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
8. Let it however be clearly borne in mind that nothing
of all this is in the least degree essential to my argument.
Eusebius, (for aught that I know or care,) may be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">solely</span></em>
responsible for every word that he has delivered concerning
S. Mark xvi. 9-20. Every link in my argument will remain
undisturbed, and the conclusion will be still precisely
the same, whether the mistaken Criticism before us originated
with another or with himself.

XII. But <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em>, (it may reasonably be asked,)‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em> should

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I answer,‚ÄîI suppose it was because the Lections which
respectively ended and began at that place were so many,
and were Lections of such unusual importance. Thus,‚Äî(1)
On the 2nd Sunday after Easter, (Œ∫œÖœÅŒπŒ±Œ∫·Ωµ Œ≥·æΩ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ŒºœÖœÅŒøœÜ·ΩπœÅœâŒΩ,
as it was called,) at the Liturgy, was read S. Mark

the Melchite Syrian Christians as well as by the Greeks,<a id="noteref_443" name="noteref_443" href="#note_443"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">443</span></span></a>)
S. Mark xvi. 9-20. The severance, therefore, was at ver. 8.
(3) In certain of the Syrian Churches the liturgical section
for Easter Day was S. Mark xvi 2-8:<a id="noteref_444" name="noteref_444" href="#note_444"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">444</span></span></a> in the Churches of

lesson of the Resurrection (xvi. 1-8) also ends,‚Äîand (5)
the third (xvi. 9-20) begins, at the same place: and these
two Gospels (both in the Greek and in the Syrian Churches)
were in constant use not only at Easter, but throughout the
year.<a id="noteref_446" name="noteref_446" href="#note_446"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">446</span></span></a>
(6) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em> same third matin lesson of the Resurrection

XIII. One more circumstance, and but one, remains to
be adverted to in the way of evidence; and one more suggestion
to be offered. The circumstance is familiar indeed
to all, but its bearing on the present discussion has never
been pointed out. I allude to the fact that anciently, in
copies of the fourfold Gospel, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Gospel according to S. Mark
frequently stood last</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This is memorably the case in respect of the Codex Bezae
[vi]: more memorably yet, in respect of the Gothic version
of Ulphilas (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 360): in both of which MSS., the order
of the Gospels is (1) S. Matthew, (2) S. John, (3) S. Luke,
(4) S. Mark. This is in fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the usual Western order</span></em>. Accordingly
it is thus that the Gospels stand in the Codd. Vercellensis
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>), Veronensis (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>), Palatinus
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">e</span></span>), Brixianus (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">f</span></span>) of the
old Latin version. But this order is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exclusively</span></em> Western.
It is found in Cod. 309. It is also observed in Matthaei's
Codd. 13, 14, (which last is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our</span></em> Evan. 256), at Moscow. And
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page240">[pg 240]</span><a name="Pg240" id="Pg240" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in the same order Eusebius and others of the ancients<a id="noteref_451" name="noteref_451" href="#note_451"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">451</span></span></a> are
occasionally observed to refer to the four Gospels,‚Äîwhich
induces a suspicion that they were not unfamiliar with it.
Nor is this all. In Codd. 19 and 90 the Gospel according
to S. Mark stands last; though in the former of these the
order of the three antecedent Gospels is (1) S. John, (2) S.
Matthew, (3) S. Luke;<a id="noteref_452" name="noteref_452" href="#note_452"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">452</span></span></a>
in the latter, (1) S. John, (2) S. Luke,
(3) S. Matthew. What need of many words to explain the
bearing of these facts on the present discussion? Of course
it will have <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">sometimes</span></em> happened that S. Mark xvi. 8 came to
be written <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at the bottom of the left hand page</span></em> of a
MS.<a id="noteref_453" name="noteref_453" href="#note_453"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">453</span></span></a> And
we have but to suppose that in the case of one such Codex
the next leaf, which would have been <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the last</span></em>, was
missing,‚Äî(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very thing which has happened in respect of one of the
Codices at Moscow</span></em><a id="noteref_454" name="noteref_454" href="#note_454"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">454</span></span></a>)‚Äîand what else
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">could</span></em> result when a copyist reached the words,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
but the very phenomenon which has exercised critics so sorely
and which gives rise to the whole of the present discussion?
The copyist will have brought S. Mark's Gospel to an end
there, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of course</span></em>. What else could he possibly do?...
Somewhat less excusably was our learned countryman Mill
betrayed into the statement, (inadvertently adopted by Wetstein,
Griesbach, and Tischendorf,) that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last verse of
S. John's Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is omitted</span></em> in Cod. 63:‚Äù</span> the truth of the

</span><span class="tei tei-pb" id="page241">[pg 241]</span><a name="Pg241" id="Pg241" class="tei tei-anchor"></a><span style="font-style: italic">
last leaf</span></em> of Cod. 63,‚Äîon which the last verse of S. John's
Gospel was demonstrably once written,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has been
lost</span></em>.<a id="noteref_455" name="noteref_455" href="#note_455"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">455</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
XIV. To sum up.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. It will be perceived that I suppose the omission of
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last Twelve Verses‚Äù</span> of S. Mark's Gospel to have
originated in a sheer error and misconception on the part
of some very ancient Copyist. He <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">saw</span></em> Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ written after
ver. 8: he <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">assumed</span></em> that it was the Subscription, or at least
that it denoted <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe End,‚Äù</span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of the Gospel</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Whether certain ancient Critics, because it was acceptable
to them, were not found to promote this mistake,‚Äîit
is useless to inquire. That there may have arisen some
old harmonizer of the Gospels, who, (in the words of Eusebius,)
was disposed to <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúregard what followed as superfluous
from its seeming inconsistency with the testimony of
the other Evangelists;‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_456" name="noteref_456" href="#note_456"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">456</span></span></a>‚Äîand that in this way the error
became propagated;‚Äîis likely enough. But an error it
most certainly was: and to that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">error</span></em>, the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">accident</span></em> described
in the last preceding paragraph <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">would have</span></em> very materially
conduced, and it may have very easily done so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. I request however that it may be observed that the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaccident‚Äù</span> is not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">needed</span></em> in order to account for the <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúerror.‚Äù</span>
The mere presence of Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ at ver. 8, so near the end of
the Gospel, would be quite enough to occasion it. And we
have seen that in very ancient times the word Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ frequently
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did</span></em> occur in an altogether exceptional manner in
that very place. Moreover, we have ascertained that its
meaning was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not understood</span></em> by the transcribers of ancient
MSS.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. And will any one venture to maintain that it is to him
a thing incredible that an intelligent copyist of the
iii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> century,
because he read the words Œ§Œü Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ at S. Mark xvi. 8,
can have been beguiled thereby into the supposition that
those words indicated <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe End‚Äù</span> of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>?‚ÄîShall
I be told that, even if <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> can have so entirely overlooked
the meaning of the liturgical sign as to suffer it
to insinuate itself into his text,<a id="noteref_457" name="noteref_457" href="#note_457"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">457</span></span></a> it is nevertheless so improbable
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page242">[pg 242]</span><a name="Pg242" id="Pg242" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
as to pass all credence that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> can have supposed
that it designated <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the termination of the Gospel</span></em> of the second
Evangelist?‚ÄîFor all reply, I take leave to point out that
Scholz, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles, and Mai and the
rest of the Critics have, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one and all, without exception, misunderstood
the same word occurring in the same place, and in
precisely the same way</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yes. The forgotten inadvertence of a solitary Scribe in
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> or <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">third</span></em> century has been, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the
nineteenth</span></em>, deliberately
reproduced, adopted, and stereotyped by every Critic
and every Editor of the New Testament in turn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
What wonder,‚Äî(I propose the question deliberately,)‚ÄîWhat
wonder that an ancient Copyist should have been misled
by a phenomenon which in our own days is observed to
have imposed upon two generations of professed Biblical
Critics discussing this very textual problem, and therefore
fully on their guard against delusion?<a id="noteref_458" name="noteref_458" href="#note_458"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">458</span></span></a> To this hour,
the illustrious Editors of the text of the Gospels are clearly, one
and all, labouring under the grave error of supposing that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ + œÑ·Ω≥ŒªŒøœÇ,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(for which they are so careful
to refer us to <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCod. 22,‚Äù</span>)‚Äîis an indication that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em>, by
rights, comes <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">End</span></span>‚Äù</span><span style="font-style: italic"> of the Gospel according to
S. Mark</span></em>. They have failed to perceive that Œ§ŒïŒõŒüŒ£ in that place is only
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a liturgical sign</span></em>,‚Äîthe same with which (in its contracted
form) they are sufficiently familiar; and that it serves no
other purpose whatever, but to mark that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">there</span></em> a famous
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ecclesiastical Lection</span></em> comes to an end.

has been heard on both sides. A just Sentence will assuredly

ask leave to direct attention to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">single issue</span></em> which
has to be decided, and which has been strangely thrust into
the background and practically kept out of sight, by those
who have preceded me in this Investigation. The case
stands simply thus:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It being freely admitted that, in the beginning of the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century,
there must have existed Copies of the Gospels
in which the last chapter of S. Mark extended no
further than ver. 8, the Question arises,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">How is this phenomenon
to be accounted for?</span></em>... The problem is not only
highly interesting and strictly legitimate, but it is even
inevitable. In the immediately preceding chapter, I have
endeavoured to solve it, and I believe in a wholly unsuspected
way.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the most recent Editors of the text of the New Testament,
declining to entertain so much as the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibility</span></em> that
certain copies of the second Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">had experienced mutilation
in very early times</span></em> in respect of these Twelve concluding
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page244">[pg 244]</span><a name="Pg244" id="Pg244" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Verses, have chosen to occupy themselves rather with conjectures
as to how it may have happened that S. Mark's
Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was without a conclusion from the very first</span></em>. Persuaded
that no more probable account is to be given of the phenomenon
than that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Evangelist himself put forth a Gospel
which</span></em> (for some unexplained reason) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">terminated abruptly at
the words</span></em> ·ºêœÜŒøŒ≤Œø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒø Œ≥·Ω±œÅ (chap. xvi. 8),‚Äîthey have unhappily
seen fit to illustrate the liveliness of this conviction
of theirs, by presenting the world with his Gospel mutilated
in this particular way. Practically, therefore, the question
has been reduced to the following single issue:‚ÄîWhether
of the two suppositions which follow is the more reasonable:
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">First</span></span>,‚ÄîThat the Gospel according to S. Mark, as it left the
hands of its inspired Author, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was in this imperfect or unfinished
state</span></em>; ending abruptly at (what we call now) the 8th verse
of the last chapter:‚Äîof which solemn circumstance, at the
end of eighteen centuries, Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê are the alone
surviving Manuscript witnesses?... or,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Secondly</span></span>,‚ÄîThat certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">having suffered mutilation</span></em> in respect of their Twelve concluding
Verses in the post-Apostolic age, Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê are the
only examples of MSS. so mutilated which are known to

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We listen with astonishment; contenting ourselves with
modestly suggesting that surely it will be time to conjecture
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> S. Mark's Gospel was left by its Divinely inspired
Author in an unfinished state, when the fact has been established

request to be furnished with some evidence of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that fact</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But not a particle of Evidence is forthcoming. It is not
even pretended that any such evidence exists. Instead, we
are magisterially informed by <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe first Biblical Critic in

it is assumed to be a more reasonable supposition,‚Äî(Œ±) That
S. Mark published an imperfect Gospel; and that the Twelve
Verses with which his Gospel concludes were the fabrication
of a subsequent age; than,‚Äî(Œ≤) That some ancient

omissions which only do not provoke the same amount
of attention because they are of less moment. One such
extraordinary depravation of the Text, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in which they also
stand alone among MSS.</span></em> and to which their patrons are observed
to appeal with triumphant complacency, has been
already made the subject of distinct investigation. I am
much mistaken if it has not been shewn in my
VII<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> chapter,
that the omission of the words ·ºêŒΩ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉ·ø≥ from Ephes. i. 1,
is just as unauthorized,‚Äîquite as serious a blemish,‚Äîas the
suppression of S. Mark xvi. 9-20.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, in the face of facts like these, and in the absence of
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any Evidence whatever</span></em> to prove that S. Mark's Gospel was
imperfect from the first,‚ÄîI submit that an hypothesis so
violent and improbable, as well as so wholly uncalled for,
is simply undeserving of serious attention. For,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) It is plain from internal considerations that the
improbability of the hypothesis is excessive; <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe contents
of these Verses being such as to preclude the supposition
that they were the work of a post-Apostolic period. The
very difficulties which they present afford the strongest presumption
of their genuineness.‚Äù</span> No fabricator of a supplement
to S. Mark's Gospel would have ventured on introducing
so many minute <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">seeming</span></em> discrepancies: and certainly

<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúhis contemporaries would not have accepted and
transmitted such an addition,‚Äù</span> if he had. It has also been
shewn at great length that the Internal Evidence for the
genuineness of these Verses is overwhelmingly
strong.<a id="noteref_477" name="noteref_477" href="#note_477"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">477</span></span></a> But,

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2nd.) Even external Evidence is not wanting. It has
been acutely pointed out long since, that the absence of
a vast assemblage of various Readings in this place, is, in
itself, a convincing argument that we have here to do with
no spurious appendage to the Gospel.<a id="noteref_478" name="noteref_478" href="#note_478"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">478</span></span></a> Were this a deservedly
suspected passage, it must have shared the fate of
all other deservedly (or undeservedly) suspected passages.
It never could have come to pass that the various Readings
which these Twelve Verses exhibit would be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">considerably
fewer</span></em> than those which attach to the last twelve verses of
any of the other three Gospels.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3rd.) And then surely, if the original Gospel of S. Mark
had been such an incomplete work as is feigned, the fact
would have been notorious from the first, and must needs
have become the subject of general comment.<a id="noteref_479" name="noteref_479" href="#note_479"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">479</span></span></a> It may be
regarded as certain that so extraordinary a circumstance
would have been largely remarked upon by the Ancients, and
that evidence of the fact would have survived in a hundred
quarters. It is, I repeat, simply incredible that Tradition
would have proved so utterly neglectful of her office as to
remain <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quite</span></em> silent on such a subject, if the facts had been
such as are imagined. Either Papias, or else John the Presbyter,‚ÄîJustin
Martyr, or Hegesippus, or one of the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSeniores
apud Iren√¶um,‚Äù</span>‚ÄîClemens Alexandrinus, or Tertullian,

Eusebius, yet certainly Jerome,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> early Writer, I say,
must <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">certainly</span></em> have recorded the tradition that S. Mark's
Gospel, as it came from the hands of its inspired author, was
an incomplete or unfinished work. The silence of the Ancients,
joined to the inherent improbability of the conjecture,‚Äî(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em>
silence so profound, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">this</span></em> improbability so gross!)‚Äîis
enough, I submit, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the entire absence of Evidence on the
other side</span></em>, to establish <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the very contradictory</span></em> of the alternative
which recent Critics are so strenuous in recommending to
our acceptance.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4th.) But on the contrary. We have indirect yet convincing
testimony that the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">oldest</span></em> copies of all <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">did contain</span></em> the
Verses in question:<a id="noteref_480" name="noteref_480" href="#note_480"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">480</span></span></a> while so far are any of the Writers
just now enumerated from recording that these verses were
absent from the early copies, that five out of those ten
Fathers actually quote, or else refer to the verses in question
in a way which shews that in their day they were the recognised
termination of S. Mark's Gospel.<a id="noteref_481" name="noteref_481" href="#note_481"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">481</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We consider ourselves at liberty, therefore, to turn our
attention to the rival alternative. Our astonishment is even
excessive that it should have been seriously expected of us
that we could accept without Proof of any sort,‚Äîwithout
a particle of Evidence, external, internal, or even traditional,‚Äîthe
extravagant hypothesis that S. Mark put forth an
unfinished Gospel; when the obvious and easy alternative
solicits us, of supposing,

II. That, at some period <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">subsequent</span></em> to the time of the
Evangelist, certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel suffered that
mutilation in respect of their last Twelve Verses of which
we meet with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no trace whatever, no record of any sort, until
the beginning of the fourth century</span></em>.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(i.) And the facts which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">now</span></em> meet us on the very threshold,
are in a manner conclusive: for if Papias and Justin
Martyr [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 150] do not refer to, yet certainly Iren√¶us
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 185] and Hippolytus [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span>
190-227] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">distinctly quote</span></em> Six out of the Twelve suspected
Verses,‚Äîwhich are also met with in the two oldest Syriac Versions, as well as
in the old Latin Translation. Now the latest of these authorities is

earlier by full a hundred years than <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the earliest record</span></em> that
the verses in question were ever absent from ancient MSS.
At the eighth Council of Carthage, (as Cyprian relates,)
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 256] Vincentius a Thiberi, one of the eighty-seven
African Bishops there assembled, quoted the 17th verse in

(iii.) Early in the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century, however, we
are encountered by a famous place in the writings of Eusebius
[<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 300-340], who, (as I have elsewhere
explained,<a id="noteref_485" name="noteref_485" href="#note_485"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">485</span></span></a>)
is the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> Father who delivers any independent testimony on this subject
at all. What he says has been strangely misrepresented.
It is simply as follows:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) One, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarinus,‚Äù</span> is introduced <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">quoting this part of
S. Mark's Gospel without suspicion</span></em>, and enquiring, How its
opening statement is to be reconciled with S. Matth. xxviii. 1?
Eusebius, in reply, points out that a man whose only object
was to get rid of the difficulty, might adopt the expedient of
saying that this last section of S. Mark's Gospel <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúis <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not
found in all the copies</span></em>:‚Äù</span> (Œº·Ω¥ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÅœÄ·æ∂œÉŒπ œÜ·Ω≥œÅŒµœÉŒ∏Œ±Œπ.) Declining,
however, to act thus presumptuously in respect of anything
claiming to be a part of Evangelical Scripture, (Œø·ΩêŒ¥·æΩ ·ΩÅœÑŒπŒø·ø¶ŒΩ

begins: and he enters at once without hesitation on an elaborate
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page250">[pg 250]</span><a name="Pg250" id="Pg250" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
discussion to shew <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">how the two places may be

What there is in this to countenance the notion that
in the opinion of Eusebius <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Gospel according to S. Mark
originally terminated at the 8th verse of the last chapter,‚Äù</span>‚ÄîI
profess myself unable to discover. I draw from his words
the precisely opposite inference. It is not even clear to me
that the Verses in dispute were absent from the copy which
Eusebius habitually employed. He certainly quotes one of
those verses once and again.<a id="noteref_487" name="noteref_487" href="#note_487"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">487</span></span></a> On the other hand, the express
statement of Victor of Antioch [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 450?] <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that he
knew of the mutilation, but had ascertained by Critical research
the genuineness of this Section of Scripture, and had adopted the
Text of the authentic </span><span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPalestinian‚Äù</span><span style="font-style: italic"> Copy</span></em>,<a id="noteref_488" name="noteref_488" href="#note_488"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">488</span></span></a>‚Äîis more than
enough to outweigh the faint presumption created (as some
might think) by the words of Eusebius, that his own copy
was without it. And yet, as already stated, there is nothing
whatever to shew that Eusebius himself deliberately rejected
the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel. Still less does
that Father anywhere say, or even hint, that in his judgment
the original Text of S. Mark was without them. If he
may be judged by his words, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he accepted them as genuine</span></em>: for
(what is at least certain) he argues upon their contents at
great length, and apparently without misgiving.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>) It is high time however to point out that, after all,
the question to be decided is, not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what Eusebius thought</span></em> on
this subject, but what is historically probable. As a plain
matter of fact, the sum of the Patristic Evidence against
these Verses is the hypothetical suggestion of Eusebius
already quoted; which, (after a fashion well understood by
those who have given any attention to these studies), is observed
to have rapidly propagated itself in the congenial soil
of the v<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century. And even if it could be
shewn that Eusebius deliberately <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">rejected</span></em> this portion of Scripture,
(which has never been done,)‚Äîyet, inasmuch as it may be regarded as
certain that those famous codices in the library of his friend

Pamphilus at C√¶sarea, to which the ancients habitually referred,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognised it as genuine</span></em>,<a id="noteref_489" name="noteref_489" href="#note_489"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">489</span></span></a>‚Äîthe only sufferer from such
a conflict of evidence would surely be Eusebius himself: (not
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Mark</span></em>, I say, but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eusebius</span></em>:) who is observed to employ an
incorrect text of Scripture on many other occasions; and
must (in such case) be held to have been unduly partial to
copies of S. Mark in the mutilated condition of Cod. B or
Cod. ◊ê. His words were translated by Jerome;<a id="noteref_490" name="noteref_490" href="#note_490"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">490</span></span></a> adopted by

the last time in his Commentary on the Gospels, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 1116.
Exaggerated and misunderstood, behold them resuscitated after an interval of
seven centuries by Griesbach, and Tischendorf, and Tregelles
and the rest: again destined to fall into a congenial,
though very differently prepared soil; and again destined
(I venture to predict) to die out and soon to be forgotten
for ever.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(iv.) After all that has gone before, our two oldest Codices
(Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê) which alone witness to the truth of
Eusebius' testimony as to the state of certain copies of the
Gospels in his own day, need not detain us long. They are
thought to be as old as the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century: they are certainly without the concluding section of S. Mark's Gospel. But
it may not be forgotten that both Codices alike are disfigured
throughout by errors, interpolations and omissions
without number; that their testimony is continually divergent;
and that it often happens that where they both
agree they are both demonstrably in
error.<a id="noteref_495" name="noteref_495" href="#note_495"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">495</span></span></a> Moreover, it is
a highly significant circumstance that the Vatican Codex
(B), which is the more ancient of the two, exhibits <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a vacant
column</span></em> at the end of S. Mark's Gospel,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only vacant column
in the whole codex</span></em>: whereby it is shewn that the Copyist was
aware of the existence of the Twelve concluding Verses of
S. Mark's Gospel, even though he left them out:<a id="noteref_496" name="noteref_496" href="#note_496"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">496</span></span></a> while the

(I.) And thus we are brought back to the point from
which we started. We are reminded that the one thing
to be accounted for is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the mutilated condition of certain copies
of S. Mark's Gospel in the beginning of the fourth century</span></em>;
of which, Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê are the two solitary surviving
specimens,‚ÄîEusebius, the one historical witness. We have
to decide, I mean, between the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">evidence</span></em> for this
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>,‚Äî(namely, that within the first two centuries and a-half of
our √¶ra, the Gospel according to S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">suffered mutilation</span></em>;)‚Äîand the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">reasonableness</span></em> of the other <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></em>, namely, that S. Mark's
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">original autograph</span></em> extended no farther than ch. xvi. 8. All
is reduced to this one issue; and unless any are prepared
to prove that the Twelve familiar Verses (ver. 9 to ver. 20)
with which S. Mark ends his Gospel <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> be his,‚Äî(I have
proved on the contrary that he must needs be thought to

to persist in asseverating that the reason why those verses
are not found in our two Codexes of the iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century must be because they did not exist in the original autograph of
the Evangelist. What else is this but to set unsupported
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">opinion</span></em>, or rather unreasoning <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prejudice</span></em>, before the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">historical evidence</span></em> of a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fact</span></em>? The assumption is not only
gratuitous, arbitrary, groundless; but it is discountenanced by the evidence
of MSS., of Versions, of Fathers, (Versions and Fathers much older than the
iv<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> century:) is rendered
in the highest degree improbable by every internal, every

external consideration: is condemned by <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the deliberate judgment
of the universal Church</span></em>,‚Äîwhich, in its corporate capacity,
for eighteen hundred years, in all places, has not only
solemnly accepted the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel
as genuine, but has even singled them out for special
honour.<a id="noteref_499" name="noteref_499" href="#note_499"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">499</span></span></a>

(II.) Let it be asked in conclusion,‚Äî(for this prolonged
discussion is now happily at an end,)‚ÄîAre any inconveniences
likely to result from a frank and loyal admission,
(<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the absence of any Evidence whatever to the contrary</span></em>,) that
doubtless the last Twelve Verses of S. Mark's Gospel are
just as worthy of acceptation as the rest? It might reasonably
be supposed, from the strenuous earnestness with which
the rejection of these Verses is generally advocated, that
some considerations must surely be assignable why the
opinion of their genuineness ought on no account to be
entertained. Do any such reasons exist? Are any inconveniences

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">No</span></em> reasons whatever are assignable, I reply; neither are
there <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">any</span></em> inconvenient consequences of any sort to be

confessed, the result proves damaging enough.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will only follow,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st) That Cod. B and Cod. ◊ê must be henceforth allowed
to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in one more serious particular</span></em> untrustworthy and erring
witnesses. They have been convicted, in fact, of bearing
false witness in respect of S. Mark xvi. 9-20, where their
evidence had been hitherto reckoned upon with the most
undoubting confidence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2ndly) That the critical statements of recent Editors,
and indeed the remarks of Critics generally, in respect of
S. Mark xvi. 9-20, will have to undergo serious revision:
in every important particular, will have to be unconditionally
withdrawn.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3rdly) That, in all future critical editions of the New Testament,
these <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTwelve Verses‚Äù</span> will have to be restored to
their rightful honours: never more appearing disfigured
with brackets, encumbered with doubts, banished from their
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page254">[pg 254]</span><a name="Pg254" id="Pg254" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
context, or molested with notes of suspicion. On the contrary.
A few words of caution against the resuscitation
of what has been proved to be a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúvulgar error,‚Äù</span> will have
henceforth to be introduced <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in memoriam rei</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4thly) Lastly, men must be no longer taught to look
with distrust on this precious part of the Deposit; and
encouraged to dispute the Divine sayings which it contains
on the plea that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perhaps</span></em> they may not be Divine, after all;
for that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">probably</span></em> the entire section is not genuine. They
must be assured, on the contrary, that these Twelve Verses
are wholly undistinguishable in respect of genuineness from
the rest of the Gospel of S. Mark; and it may not be amiss
to remind them the Creed called the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAthanasian‚Äù</span> speaks
no other language than that employed by the Divine Author
of our Religion and Object of our Faith. The Church warns
her children against the peril incurred by as many as wilfully
reject the Truth, in no other language but that of the
Great Head of the Church. No person may presume to
speak disparagingly of S. Mark xvi. 16, any more.

(III.) Whether,‚Äîafter the foregoing exposure of a very
prevalent and highly popular, but at the same time most
calamitous misapprehension,‚Äîit will not become necessary
for Editors of the Text of the New Testament to reconsider
their conclusions in countless other places:‚Äîwhether they
must not be required to review their method, and to remodel
their text throughout, now that they have been shewn the
insecurity of the foundation on which they have so confidently
builded, and been forced to reverse their verdict in
respect of a place of Scripture where at least they supposed
themselves impregnable;‚ÄîI forbear at this time to inquire.

So far, the evidence of mere Antiquity may be supposed

Most decisive of all, perhaps, is the fact this was the form
in which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Churches of the East</span></em> preserved the Angelic

But the text of this Hymn, as a Liturgical document,
at a yet earlier period is unequivocally established by the
combined testimony of the Apostolical Constitutions (already
quoted,) and of Chrysostom, who says expressly:‚ÄîŒï·ΩêœáŒ±œÅŒπœÉœÑŒø·ø¶ŒΩœÑŒµœÇ

1. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Iren√¶us</span></span> sides with the oldest uncials.‚ÄîNow, the Greek
of the place referred to is lost. A Latin translation is all that
survives. According to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> evidence, Iren√¶us, having quoted
the place in conformity with the Vulgate reading (iii. c. x.
¬ß 41,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloria in excelsis Deo et in terra pax hominibus bonae
voluntatis</span></span>,‚Äù</span>) presently adds,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúIn eo quod dicunt,
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloria in altissimis </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Deo</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> et in terra

est, supercaelestium factor et eorum, quae super terram
omnium conditor, his sermonibus glorificaverunt; qui suo
plasmati, hoc est hominibus suam benignitatem salutis de
caelo misit.‚Äù</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ed.</span></span> Stieren, i. 459).‚ÄîBut it must suffice
to point out (1) that these words really prove nothing: and
(2) that it would be very unsafe to build upon them, even if
they did; since (3) it is plain that the Latin translator exhibits
the place in the Latin form most familiar to himself:
(consider his substitution of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúexcelsis‚Äù</span> for <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúaltissimis.‚Äù</span>)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. Next, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Origen</span></span> is claimed on the same side, on the
strength of the following passage in (Jerome's version of)
his lost Homilies on S. Luke:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSi scriptum esset, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Super
terram pax</span></em>, et hucusque esset finita sententia, recte quaestio
nasceretur. Nunc vero in eo quod additum est, hoc est,
quod post pacem dicitur, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">In hominibus bonae voluntatis</span></em>, solvit
quaestionem. Pax enim quam non dat Dominus super
terram, non est pax bonae voluntatis.‚Äù</span> (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opp.</span></span> iii. p. 946.)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúFrom this,‚Äù</span> (says Tischendorf, who is followed by Tregelles,)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúit is plain that Origen regarded Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ as the
true reading; not Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±‚Äîwhich is now thrice found in his
Greek writings.‚Äù</span>‚ÄîBut,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Is one here more struck with the unfairness of the Critic,
or with the feebleness of his reasoning? For,‚Äî(to say nothing
of the insecurity of building on a Latin Translation,<a id="noteref_502" name="noteref_502" href="#note_502"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">502</span></span></a>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page261">[pg 261]</span><a name="Pg261" id="Pg261" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
especially in such a matter as the present,)‚ÄîHow can testimony
like this be considered to outweigh the three distinct
places in the original writings of this Father, where he
reads not Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ but Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±? Again. Why is a doubt
insinuated concerning the trustworthiness of those three
places, (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúut <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">nunc</span></em> reperitur,‚Äù</span>) where there really is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em> doubt? How is Truth ever to be attained if investigations like the
present are to be conducted in the spirit of an eager partisan,
instead of with the calm gravity of an impartial
judge?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But I may as well state plainly that the context of the
passage above quoted shews that Tischendorf's proposed inference
is inadmissible. Origen is supposing some one to
ask the following question:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSince Angels on the night
when <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Christ</span></span> was born proclaimed <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòon earth
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Peace</span></em>,‚Äô</span>‚Äîwhy does our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> say,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòI am <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> come to send Peace upon
earth, but a sword?‚Äô</span>... Consider,‚Äù</span> (he proceeds) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhether
the answer may not be this:‚Äù</span>‚Äîand then comes the
extract given above. Origen, (to express oneself with colloquial
truthfulness,) is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">at his old tricks</span></em>. He is evidently acquainted
with the reading Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ: and because it enables
him to offer (what appears to him) an ingenious solution of
a certain problem, he adopts it for the nonce: his proposal
to take the words Œµ·º∞œÅ·ΩµŒΩŒ∑ Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ together, being simply
preposterous,‚Äîas no one ever knew better than Origen
himself.<a id="noteref_503" name="noteref_503" href="#note_503"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">503</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. Lastly, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Cyril of Jerusalem</span></span> is invariably cited by the
latest Critics as favouring the reading Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ. Those
learned persons have evidently overlooked the candid acknowledgment
of De Toutt√©e, Cyril's editor, (p. 180, cf.
bottom of p. 102,) that though <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the MSS. of Cyril</span></em> exhibit
Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±, yet in his editorial capacity he had ventured <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to print</span></em>
Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ. This therefore is one more Patristic attestation
to the trustworthiness of the Textus Receptus in respect of
S. Luke ii. 14, which has been hitherto unaccountably lost
sight of by Critics. (May I, without offence, remind Editors
of Scripture that instead of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">copying</span></em>, they ought in every instance
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to verify</span></em> their references?)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. The history of this corruption of the Text is not hard
to discover. It is interesting and instructive also.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) In the immediately post-Apostolic age,‚Äîif not earlier
still,‚Äîsome Copyist will have omitted the ·ºêŒΩ before ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ.
The resemblance of the letters and the similarity
of the sound (ŒïŒù, ŒëŒù,) misled him:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
ŒïŒùŒëŒùŒòŒ°Œ©Œ†ŒüŒôŒ£
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Every one must see at a glance how easily the thing may
have happened. (It is in fact precisely what <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">has</span></em> happened
in Acts iv. 12; where, for ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ, D and a few cursive
MSS. read ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ,‚Äîbeing countenanced therein by
the Latin Versions generally, and by them only.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2.) The result however‚Äî(Œ¥·ΩπŒæŒ± ·ºêŒΩ ·Ωëœà·Ω∑œÉœÑŒøŒπœÇ ŒòŒµ·ø∑ Œ∫Œ±·Ω∂
·ºêœÄ·Ω∂ Œ≥·øÜœÇ Œµ·º∞œÅ·ΩµŒΩŒ∑ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±)‚Äîwas obviously an impossible
sentence. It could not be allowed to stand. And yet
it was not by any means clear what had happened to it. In
order, as it seems, to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">force</span></em> a meaning into the words, some
one with the best intentions will have put the sign of the
genitive (Œ£) at the end of Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±. The copy so depraved
was destined to play an important part; for it became the
fontal source of the Latin Version, which exhibits the place
thus:‚Äî<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Gloria in altissimis </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Deo</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">, et in
terra pax hominibus bonae voluntatis....</span></span> It is evident, by the way, (if the
quotation from Iren√¶us, given above, is to be depended upon,)
that Iren√¶us must have so read the place: (viz. Œµ·º∞œÅ·ΩµŒΩŒ∑
·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3.) To restore the preposition (ŒïŒù) which had been accidentally
thrust out, and to obliterate the sign of the genitive
(Œ£) which had been without authority thrust in, was an
obvious proceeding. Accordingly, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every Greek Evangelium
extant</span></em> exhibits ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ: while <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all but four</span></em> (B, ◊ê, A, D)
read Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±. In like manner, into some MSS. of the Vulgate
(e.g. the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cod. Amiatinus</span></span>,) the preposition (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúin‚Äù</span>) has
found its way back; but the genitive (<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbonae voluntatis‚Äù</span>)
has never been rectified in a single copy of the Latin version.‚ÄîThe
Gothic represents a copy which exhibited ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÄŒΩŒ∏œÅ·ΩΩœÄŒøŒπœÇ
Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ.<a id="noteref_504" name="noteref_504" href="#note_504"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">504</span></span></a>
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page263">[pg 263]</span><a name="Pg263" id="Pg263" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The consequence is that a well-nigh untranslatable expression
retains its place in the Vulgate to the present hour.
Whether (with Origen) we connect Œµ·ΩêŒ¥ŒøŒ∫·Ω∑Œ±œÇ with Œµ·º∞œÅ·ΩµŒΩŒ∑,‚Äîor
(with the moderns) we propose to understand <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúmen of good
pleasure,‚Äù</span>‚Äîthe result is still the same. The harmony of
the three-part Anthem which the Angels sang on the night
of the Nativity is hopelessly marred, and an unintelligible
discord substituted in its place. Logic, Divinity, Documents
are here all at one. The reading of Stephens is unquestionably
correct. The reading of the latest Editors is as certainly
corrupt. This is a case therefore where the value of
Patristic testimony becomes strikingly apparent. It affords
also one more crucial proof of the essential hollowness
of the theory on which it has been recently proposed by
Lachmann, Tischendorf, Tregelles and the rest to reconstruct
the text of the New Testament.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To some, it may perhaps seem unreasonable that so many
words should be devoted to the establishment of the text of
a single place of Scripture,‚Äîdepending, as that text does,
on the insertion or the omission of a single letter. I am
content to ask in reply,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">What</span></em> is important, if not the
utterance of Heaven, when, at the laying of the corner-stone
of the New Creation, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe Morning Stars sang together,
and all the Sons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> shouted for joy?‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. Only one word in conclusion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Whenever the time comes for the Church of England to
revise her Authorized Version (1611), it will become necessary
that she should in the first instance instruct some of the
more judicious and learned of her sons carefully to revise
the Greek Text of Stephens (1550). Men require to know
precisely what it is they have to translate before they can
pretend to translate it. As for supposing that Scholars who
have been appointed to revise <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a Translation</span></em> are competent at
a moment's notice, as every fresh difficulty presents itself, to
develop the skill requisite for revising <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the original Text</span></em>,‚Äîit
is clearly nothing else but supposing that experts in
one Science can at pleasure shew themselves proficients in
another.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But it so happens that, on the present occasion, that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">other</span></em>
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page264">[pg 264]</span><a name="Pg264" id="Pg264" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Science is one of exceeding difficulty. Revisionists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">here</span></em>
will find it necessary altogether to disabuse their minds of
the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Theory</span></em> of Textual Criticism which is at present the dominant
and the popular one,‚Äîand of which I have made
it my business to expose the fallaciousness, in respect of
several crucial texts, in the course of the present work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I cannot so far forget the unhappy circumstances of the
times as to close this note without the further suggestion,
(sure therein of the approval of our trans-Atlantic brethren,)
that, for a Revision of the Authorized Version to enjoy the
confidence of the Nation, and to procure for itself acceptance
at the hands of the Church,‚Äîit will be found necessary
that the work should be confided to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Churchmen</span></em>. The
Church may never abdicate her function of being <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúa Witness
and a Keeper of Holy Writ.‚Äù</span> Neither can she, without
flagrant inconsistency and scandalous consequence, ally
herself in the work of Revision with the Sects. Least of all
may she associate with herself in the sacred undertaking
an Unitarian Teacher,‚Äîone who avowedly [see the letter
of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOne of the Revisionists, G. V. S.,‚Äù</span> in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTimes‚Äù</span> of
July 11, 1870] denies the eternal <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span>head of her
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>.
That the individual alluded to has shewn any peculiar aptitude
for the work of a Revisionist; or that he is a famous
Scholar; or that he can boast of acquaintance with any of
the less familiar departments of Sacred Learning; is not
even pretended. (It would matter nothing if the reverse
were the case.) What else, then, is this but to offer a deliberate
insult to the Majesty of Heaven in the Divine Person
of Him who is alike the Object of the Everlasting Gospel,
and its Author?

are scarcely ever original,‚Äîis what no one will deny who

Cyril, is entirely to misrepresent the case and hopelessly to
perplex the question.

given any time and attention to a subject like the present to
contribute the result, (however slender and unsatisfactory it
may prove,) to the common store. Let abler men enlarge
the ensuing scanty notices, and correct me if in any respect
I shall have inadvertently fallen into error.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. There exists a Commentary, then, on S. Mark's Gospel,
which generally claims on its front <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor, Presbyter

His Latin version found its way at once into <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúBibliothec√¶,‚Äù</span>
(or Collections of Writings of the Fathers,) and has been
again and again reprinted.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. The Greek text of Victor was first published at Rome
by Peter Possinus in 1673, from a MS. existing somewhere
in Germany; which Bathazar Corderius had transcribed and
presented to Possinus about thirty years before. Corderius
gave Possinus at the same time his transcript of an anonymous
Commentary on S. Mark preserved in the Vatican;
and Possinus had already in his possession the transcript of
a third Commentary on the same Evangelist (also anonymous)
which he had obtained from the Library of Charles
de Montchal, Abp. of Toulouse. These three transcripts Possinus
published in a well-known volume. It is to be wished
that he had kept them distinct, instead of to some extent
blending their contents confusedly into one.<a id="noteref_510" name="noteref_510" href="#note_510"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">510</span></span></a> Still, the dislocated
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page271">[pg 271]</span><a name="Pg271" id="Pg271" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
paragraphs of Victor of Antioch are recognisable by
the name of their author (<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVictor Antiochenus‚Äù</span>) prefixed
to each: while <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúTolosanus‚Äù</span> designates the Toulouse MS.:
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVaticanus‚Äù</span> (or simply <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnonymus‚Äù</span>) the Vatican.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. At the end of another century, (1775) C. F. Matthaei
put forth at Moscow, with his usual skill and accuracy,
a new and independent Edition of Victor's Commentary:<a id="noteref_511" name="noteref_511" href="#note_511"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">511</span></span></a>
the text of which is based on four of the Moscow MSS.
This work, which appeared in two parts, has become of
extraordinary rarity. I have only just ascertained (June,
1871,) that one entire Copy is preserved in this country.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
4. Lastly, (in 1840,) Dr. J. A. Cramer, in the first volume
of his <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catenae</span></span> on the N. T., reproduced Victor's work from
independent MS. sources. He took for his basis two Codices
in the Paris Library, (No. 186 and No. 188), which, however,
prove to have been anciently so exactly assimilated the one to
the other [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infr√†</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg279" class="tei tei-ref">279</a>] as to be,
in fact, but duplicates of one and the same original. Cramer supplemented their contents
from Laud. Gr. 33, (in the Bodleian:) Coisl. 23: and Reg.
178 at Paris. The result has been by far the fullest and
most satisfactory exhibition of the Commentary of Victor of
Antioch which has hitherto appeared. Only is it to be
regretted that the work should have been suffered to come
abroad disfigured in every page with errors so gross as to be
even scandalous, and with traces of slovenly editorship which
are simply unintelligible. I cannot bring myself to believe
that Dr. Cramer ever inspected the MSS. in the Paris
Library in person. Else would the slender advantage which
those abundant materials have proved to so learned and accomplished
a scholar, be altogether unaccountable. Moreover,
he is incorrect in what he says about them:<a id="noteref_512" name="noteref_512" href="#note_512"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">512</span></span></a>
while his reasons for proposing to assign the work of Victor
of Antioch to Cyril of Alexandria are undeserving of serious
attention.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On a comparison of these four Editions of the same work,
it is discovered that the Latin version of Peltanus (1580),
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page272">[pg 272]</span><a name="Pg272" id="Pg272" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">represents the same Greek text</span></em> which Possinus gave to the
world in 1673. Peltanus translates very loosely; in fact
he paraphrases rather than translates his author, and confesses
that he has taken great liberties with Victor's text.
But I believe it will be found that there can have been no
considerable discrepancy between the MS. which Peltanus
employed, and that which Possinus afterwards published.‚ÄîNot
so the text which Matthaei edited, which is in fact for
the most part, (though not invariably,) rather an Epitome
of Victor's Commentary. On the other hand, Cramer's
text is more full than that of Possinus. There seem to be
only a few lines in Possinus, here and there, which are not
to be met with in Cramer; whereas no less than twenty-eight
of Cramer's pages are not found in the work of Possinus.
Cramer's edition, therefore, is by far the most complete
which has hitherto appeared. And though it cries aloud
for revision throughout; though many important corrections
might easily be introduced into it, and the whole
brought back in countless particulars more nearly to the
state in which it is plain that Victor originally left it;‚ÄîI
question whether more than a few pages of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">additional
matter</span></em> could easily be anywhere recovered. I collated several
pages of Cramer (Oct. 1869) with every MS. of Victor in
the Paris Library; and all but invariably found that Cramer's
text was fuller than that of the MS. which lay before
me. Seldom indeed did I meet with a few lines in any
MS. which had not already seen the light in Cramer's edition.
One or other of the four Codices which he employed
seems to fill up almost every hiatus which is met with in
any of the MSS. of this Father.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For it must be stated, once for all, that an immense, and
I must add, a most unaccountable discrepancy is observable
between the several extant copies of Victor: yet not so
much in respect of various readings, or serious modifications
of his text; (though the transpositions are very frequent,
and often very mischievous;<a id="noteref_513" name="noteref_513" href="#note_513"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">513</span></span></a>) as resulting from the boundless
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page273">[pg 273]</span><a name="Pg273" id="Pg273" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
license which every fresh copyist seems to have allowed
himself chiefly in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">abridging</span></em> his author.‚ÄîTo skip a few lines:
to omit an explanatory paragraph, quotation, or digression:
to pass <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">per saltum</span></span> from the beginning to the end of a passage:
sometimes to leave out a whole page: to transpose:
to paraphrase: to begin or to end with quite a different
form of words;‚Äîproves to have been the rule. Two copyists
engaged on the same portion of Commentary are observed
to abridge it in two quite different ways. I question whether
there exist in Europe three manuscripts of Victor
which correspond entirely throughout. The result is perplexing
in a high degree. Not unfrequently (as might be
expected) we are presented with two or even three different
exhibitions of one and the same annotation.<a id="noteref_514" name="noteref_514" href="#note_514"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">514</span></span></a>
Meanwhile, as if to render the work of collation (in a manner) impossible,‚Äî(1)
Peltanus pleads guilty to having transposed
and otherwise taken liberties with the text he translated:
(2) Possinus confessedly welded three codices into one:
(3) Matthaei pieced and patched his edition out of four
MSS.; and (4) Cramer, out of five.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The only excuse I can invent for this strange licentiousness
on the part of Victor's ancient transcribers is this:‚ÄîThey
must have known perfectly well, (in fact it is obvious,)
that the work before them was really little else but
a compilation; and that Victor had already abridged in the
same merciless way the writings of the Fathers (Chrysostom
chiefly) from whom he obtained his materials. We
are to remember also, I suppose, the labour which transcription
involved, and the costliness of the skins out of
which ancient books were manufactured. But when all
has been said, I must candidly admit that the extent of
license which the ancients evidently allowed themselves
quite perplexes me.<a id="noteref_515" name="noteref_515" href="#note_515"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">515</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Why</span></em>, for example, remodel the
structure
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page274">[pg 274]</span><a name="Pg274" id="Pg274" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
of a sentence and needlessly vary its phraseology?
Never I think in my life have I been more hopelessly confused
than in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Biblioth√®que</span></span>, while attempting to collate
certain copies of Victor of Antioch.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I dismiss this feature of the case by saying that if any
person desires a sample of the process I have been describing,
he cannot do better than bestow a little attention on
the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúPreface‚Äù</span> (·ΩëœÄ·ΩπŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ) at the beginning of Victor's Commentary.
It consists of thirty-eight lines in Cramer's
edition: of which Possinus omits eleven; and Matthaei
also, eleven;‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">but not the same eleven</span></em>. On the other hand,
Matthaei<a id="noteref_516" name="noteref_516" href="#note_516"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">516</span></span></a>
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">prolongs</span></em> the Preface by eight lines. Strange to
relate, the MS. from which Cramer professes to publish, goes
on differently. If I may depend on my hasty pencilling,
after ·ºêŒ∫Œ∫ŒªŒ∑œÉ·Ω∑Œ±ŒπœÇ [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cramer</span></span>, i. p. 264, line 16,] Evan. 300,

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On referring to the work of Possinus, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúAnonymus Vaticanus‚Äù</span>
is found to exhibit so admirable a condensation (?)
of the ·ΩëœÄ·ΩπŒ∏ŒµœÉŒπœÇ in question, that it is difficult to divest oneself
of the suspicion that it must needs be an original and
independent composition; the germ out of which the longer
Preface has grown.... We inspect the first few pages of
the Commentary, and nothing but perplexity awaits us at
every step. It is not till we have turned over a few pages
that we begin to find something like exact correspondence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As for the Work,‚Äî(for I must now divest myself of the
perplexing recollections which the hurried collation of so
many MSS. left behind; and plainly state that, in spite of
all, I yet distinctly ascertained, and am fully persuaded
that the original work was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em>,‚Äîthe production, no doubt,
of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVictor, Presbyter of Antioch,‚Äù</span> as 19 out of the 52
MSS. declare):‚ÄîFor the Commentary itself, I say, Victor
explains at the outset what his method had been. Having
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page275">[pg 275]</span><a name="Pg275" id="Pg275" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
failed to discover any separate exposition of S. Mark's Gospel,
he had determined to construct one, by collecting the
occasional notices scattered up and down the writings of
Fathers of the Church.<a id="noteref_517" name="noteref_517" href="#note_517"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">517</span></span></a> Accordingly, he presents us in
the first few lines of his Commentary (p. 266) with a brief
quotation from the work of Eusebius <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto Marinus, on the
seeming inconsistency of the Evangelical accounts of the
Resurrection;‚Äù</span> following it up with a passage from <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe
vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
[vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>?]
tome of Origen's Exegetics on S. John's Gospel.‚Äù</span>
We are thus presented at the outset with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">two</span></em> of Victor's
favorite authorities. The work of Eusebius just named he
was evidently thoroughly familiar with.<a id="noteref_518" name="noteref_518" href="#note_518"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">518</span></span></a>
I suspect that he has many an unsuspected quotation from its pages. Towards
the end of his Commentary, (as already elsewhere explained,)
he quotes it once and again.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Of Origen also Victor was evidently very fond<a id="noteref_519" name="noteref_519" href="#note_519"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">519</span></span></a>: and his
words on two or three occasions seem to shew that he had
recourse besides habitually to the exegetical labours of Apolinarius,
Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Titus of Bostra.<a id="noteref_520" name="noteref_520" href="#note_520"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">520</span></span></a> Passages from Cyril of Alexandria are occasionally met
with;<a id="noteref_521" name="noteref_521" href="#note_521"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">521</span></span></a> and once at least (p. 370) he has an extract from Basil.
The historian Josephus he sometimes refers to by name.<a id="noteref_522" name="noteref_522" href="#note_522"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">522</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the Father to whom Victor is chiefly indebted is
Chrysostom,‚Äîwhom he styles <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe blessed John, Bishop of
the Royal City;‚Äù</span> (meaning Constantinople<a id="noteref_523" name="noteref_523" href="#note_523"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">523</span></span></a>). Not that
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page276">[pg 276]</span><a name="Pg276" id="Pg276" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Victor, strictly speaking, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">transcribes</span></em> from Chrysostom; at
least, to any extent. His general practice is slightly to
adapt his Author's language to his own purpose; sometimes,
to leave out a few words; a paragraph; half a page.<a id="noteref_524" name="noteref_524" href="#note_524"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">524</span></span></a> Then,
he proceeds to quote another Father probably; or, it may
be, to offer something of his own. But he seldom gives any
intimation of what it is he does: and if it were not for the
occasional introduction of the phrase ·ΩÅ Œº·Ω≥ŒΩ œÜŒ∑œÉŒπ or ·ºÑŒªŒªŒøœÇ Œ¥·Ω≥
œÜŒ∑œÉŒπ,<a id="noteref_525" name="noteref_525" href="#note_525"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">525</span></span></a> a reader of Victor's Commentary might almost mistake
it for an original composition. So little pains does this
Author take to let his reader know when he is speaking in
his own person, when not, that he has not scrupled to retain
Chrysostom's phrases ·ºêŒ≥·Ωº Œ¥·Ω≤ Œø·º∂ŒºŒ±Œπ,<a id="noteref_526" name="noteref_526" href="#note_526"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">526</span></span></a> &amp;c. The result is that
it is often impossible to know to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">whose</span></em> sentiments we are
listening. It cannot be too clearly borne in mind that
ancient ideas concerning authorship differed entirely from
those of modern times; especially when Holy Scripture was
to be commented on.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I suspect that, occasionally, copyists of Victor's work,
as they recognised a fragment here and there, prefixed to it
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page277">[pg 277]</span><a name="Pg277" id="Pg277" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
the name of its author. This would account for the extremely
partial and irregular occurrence of such notes of
authorship; as well as explain why a name duly prefixed
in one copy is often missing in another.<a id="noteref_527" name="noteref_527" href="#note_527"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">527</span></span></a>
Whether Victor's Commentary can in strictness be called a <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCatena,‚Äù</span> or not,
must remain uncertain until some one is found willing to
undertake the labour of re-editing his pages; from which,
by the way, I cannot but think that some highly interesting
(if not some important) results would follow.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet, inasmuch as Victor never, or certainly very seldom,
prefixes to a passage from a Father <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the name of its Author</span></em>;‚Äîabove
all, seeing that sometimes, at all events, he is original,
or at least speaks in his own person;‚ÄîI think the
title of <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúCatena‚Äù</span> inappropriate to his Commentary.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
As favourable and as interesting a specimen of this work
as could be found, is supplied by his annotation on S. Mark
xiv. 3. He begins as follows, (quoting Chrysostom, p. 436):‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúOne
and the same woman seems to be spoken of by all
the Evangelists. Yet is this not the case. By three of
them one and the same seems to be spoken of; not however
by S. John, but another famous person,‚Äîthe sister of Lazarus.
This is what is said by John, the Bishop of the
Royal City.‚ÄîOrigen on the other hand says that she who,
in S. Matthew and S. Mark, poured the ointment in the
house of Simon the leper was a different person from the
sinner whom S. Luke writes about who poured the ointment
on His feet in the house of the Pharisee.‚ÄîApolinarius<a id="noteref_528" name="noteref_528" href="#note_528"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">528</span></span></a> and Theodorus say that all the Evangelists mention one and the
same person; but that John rehearses the story more accurately
than the others. It is plain, however, that Matthew,
Mark, and John speak of the same individual; for
they relate that Bethany was the scene of the transaction;
and this is a <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">village</span></em>; whereas Luke [viii. 37] speaks of some
one else; for, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòBehold,‚Äô</span> (saith he) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äòa woman <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the city</span></em>
which was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a sinner</span></em>,‚Äô</span>‚Äâ‚Äù</span> &amp;c., &amp;c.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But the most important instance by far of independent
and sound judgment is supplied by that concluding paragraph,
already quoted and largely remarked upon, at pp.
<a href="#Pg064" class="tei tei-ref">64-5</a>; in which, after rehearsing all that had been said
against the concluding verses of S. Mark's Gospel, Victor
vindicates their genuineness by appealing in his own person
to the best and the most authentic copies. The Reader is
referred to Victor's Text, which is given below, at p. <a href="#Pg288" class="tei tei-ref">288</a>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It only remains to point out, that since Chrysostom, (whom
Victor speaks of as ·ΩÅ ·ºêŒΩ ·ºÅŒ≥·Ω∑ŒøŒπœÇ,[p. 408,] and ·ΩÅ ŒºŒ±Œ∫Œ±œÅŒπŒøœÇ,
[p. 442,]) died in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 407, it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em>
be right to quote <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú401‚Äù</span>
as the date of Victor's work. Rather would <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 450 be
a more reasonable suggestion: seeing that extracts from
Cyril, who lived on till <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 444, are found here and there
in Victor's pages. We shall not perhaps materially err
if we assign <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 430-450 as Victor of Antioch's approximate
date.

I conclude these notices of an unjustly neglected Father,
by specifying the MSS. which contain his Work. Dry
enough to ordinary readers, these pages will not prove uninteresting
to the critical student. An enumeration of all
the extant Codices with which I am acquainted which contain
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor of Antioch's</span></span> Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel,

The Commentary on S. Mark is here assigned to <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor</span></span> by
name; being a recension very like that which Matthaei has published.

The correspondence between Evan. 20 and Evan. 300 [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infr√†</span></span>,

In S. Mark's Gospel, (which alone I examined,) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">every page begins with the same
syllable, both of Text and Commentary</span></em>: (i.e. Reg. 186, fol. 94 to 197
= Reg. 188, fol. 87 to 140). Not that the number of words and letters
in every line corresponds: but the discrepancy is compensated
for by a blank at the end of each column, and at the foot of each
page. Evan. 20 and Evan. 300 seem, therefore, in some mysterious
way referable to a common original. The sacred Text of these two
MSS., originally very dissimilar, has been made identical throughout;
some very ancient (the original?) possessor of Reg. 188 having
carefully assimilated the readings of his MS. to those of Reg. 186,
the more roughly written copy; which therefore, in the judgment
of the possessor of Reg. 188, exhibits the purer text. But how
then does it happen that in both Codices alike, each of the Gospels
(except S. Matthew's Gospel in Reg. 188,) ends with the attestation
that it has been collated with approved copies? Are we to suppose
that the colophon in question was added <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">after</span></em> the one text had been
assimilated to the other? This is a subject which well deserves
attention. The reader is reminded that these two Codices have

It will be found that Coisl. 23 (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">infr√†</span></span>, No. ix.) and
Coisl. 195 are derived from a common original; but Cod. 195 is the more perfect

to the other (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">supr√†</span></span>, p. <a href="#Pg271" class="tei tei-ref">271</a>.)

In conclusion, it can scarcely require to be pointed out
that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor's</span></span> Commentary,‚Äîof which the Church in her
palmiest days shewed herself so careful to multiply copies,
and of which there survive to this hour such a vast number
of specimens,‚Äîmust needs anciently have enjoyed very peculiar
favour. It is evident, in fact, that an Epitome of Chrysostom's
Homilies on S. Matthew, together with <em class="tei tei-emph"><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Victor's</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
compilation on S. Mark</span></em>,‚ÄîTitus of Bostra on S. Luke,‚Äîand
a work in the main derived from Chrysostom's Homilies on
S. John;‚Äîthat these four constituted the established Commentary
of ancient Christendom on the fourfold Gospel. Individual
copyists, no doubt, will have been found occasionally
to abridge certain of the Annotations, and to omit others:
or else, out of the multitude of Scholia by various ancient
Fathers which were evidently once in circulation, and must
have been held in very high esteem,‚Äî(Iren√¶us, Origen,
Ammonius, Eusebius, Apolinarius, Cyril, Chrysostom, the
Gregorys, Basil, Theodore of Mopsuestia, and Theodore
of Heraclea,) they will have introduced extracts according
to their individual caprice. In this way, the general
sameness of the several copies is probably to be accounted
for, while their endless discrepancy in matters of detail is
perhaps satisfactorily explained.

I have thought this very remarkable specimen of the method
of an ancient and (as I think) unjustly neglected Commentator,
deserving of extraordinary attention. Besides
presenting the reader, therefore, with what seems to be a
fair approximation to the original text of the passage, I have
subjoined as many various readings as have come to my
knowledge. It is hoped that they are given with tolerable
exactness; but I have been too often obliged to depend on
printed books and the testimony of others. I can at least
rely on the readings furnished me from the Vatican.

More pains than enough (it will perhaps be thought)
have been taken to exhibit accurately this short Scholion.
And yet, it has not been without design (the reader may be
sure) that so many various readings have been laboriously
accumulated. The result, it is thought, is eminently instructive,
and (to the student of Ecclesiastical Antiquity) important
also.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For it will be perceived by the attentive reader that not
more than two or three of the multitude of various readings
afforded by this short Scholion can have possibly resulted
from careless transcription.<a id="noteref_541" name="noteref_541" href="#note_541"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">541</span></span></a>
The rest have been unmistakably
occasioned by the merest licentiousness: every
fresh Copyist evidently considering himself at liberty to take
just whatever liberties he pleased with the words before
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page290">[pg 290]</span><a name="Pg290" id="Pg290" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
him. To amputate, or otherwise to mutilated; to abridge; to
amplify; to transpose; to remodel;‚Äîthis has been the rule
with all. The <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">types</span></em> (so to speak) are reducible to two, or
at most to three; but the varieties are almost as numerous
as the MSS. of Victor's work.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And yet it is impossible to doubt that this Scholion was
originally one, and one only. Irrecoverable perhaps, in
some of its minuter details, as the actual text of Victor
may be, it is nevertheless self-evident that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in the main</span></em> we
are in possession of what he actually wrote on this occasion.
In spite of all the needless variations observable in the manner
of stating a certain fact, it is still unmistakably one and
the same fact which is every time stated. It is invariably
declared,‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1.) That from certain copies of S. Mark's Gospel the last
Twelve Verses had been <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">LEFT OUT</span></span>; and (2) That this had
been done because their genuineness had been by certain
persons suspected: but, (3) That the Writer, convinced of
their genuineness, had restored them to their rightful place;
(4) Because he had found them in accurate copies, and in the
authentic Palestinian copy, which had supplied him with
his exemplar.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is obvious to suggest that after familiarizing ourselves
with this specimen of what proves to have been the licentious
method of the ancient copyists in respect of the text of an
early Father, we are in a position to approach more intelligently
the Commentary of Victor itself; and, to some extent,
to understand how it comes to pass that so many liberties
have been taken with it throughout. The Reader is
reminded of what has been already offered on this subject at

</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúVix differt aetate a Codice Sinaitico,‚Äù</span> says Tischendorf,
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">ed. 8va</span></span>, 1869, p. ix,) speaking of the Codex Vaticanus
(B). Yet does he perpetually designate his own Sinaitic
Codex (◊ê) as <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúomnium antiquissimus.‚Äù</span> Now,
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1) The (all but unique) sectional division of the Text of
Codex B,‚Äîconfessedly the oldest scheme of chapters extant,
is in itself a striking note of primitiveness. The author of
the Codex knew nothing, apparently, of the Eusebian method.
But I venture further to suggest that the following peculiarities
in Codex ◊ê unmistakably indicate for it a later date
than Codex B.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2) Cod. ◊ê, (like C, and other later MSS.,) is broken up
into short paragraphs throughout. The Vatican Codex, on
the contrary, has very few breaks indeed: e.g. it is without
break of any sort from S. Matth. xvii. 24 to xx. 17: whereas,
within the same limits, there are in Cod. ◊ê as many as <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">thirty</span></em>
interruptions of the context. From S. Mark xiii. 1 to the
end of the Gospel the text is absolutely continuous in Cod. B,
except in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> place: but in Cod. ◊ê it is interrupted upwards
of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">fifty</span></em> times. Again: from S. Luke xvii. 11, to the end of
the Gospel there is but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> break in Cod. B. But it is
broken into well nigh <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an hundred and fifty</span></em> short paragraphs
in Cod. ◊ê.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
There can be no doubt that the unbroken text of Codex B,
(resembling the style of the papyrus of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Hyperides</span></span> published
by Mr. Babington,) is the more ancient. The only places
where it approximates to the method of Cod. ◊ê, is where
the Commandments are briefly recited (S. Matth. xix. 18,
&amp;c.), and where our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> proclaims the eight Beatitudes
(S. Matth. v.)

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3) Again; Cod. ◊ê is prone to exhibit, on extraordinary
occasions, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a single word</span></em> in a line, as at‚Äî

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This became a prevailing fashion in the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century; e.g. when the Cod. Laudianus of the Acts (E) was written. The
only trace of anything of the kind in Cod. B is at the Genealogy
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4) At the commencement of every fresh paragraph, the
initial letter in Cod. ◊ê <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">slightly projects into the margin</span></em>,‚Äîbeyond
the left hand edge of the column; as usual in all
later MSS. This characteristic is only not undiscoverable
in Cod. B. Instances of it there are in the earlier Codex;
but they are of exceedingly rare occurrence.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5) Further; Cod. ◊ê abounds in such contractions as ŒëŒùŒüŒ£,
ŒüŒ•ŒùŒüŒ£ (with all their cases), for ŒëŒùŒòŒ°Œ©Œ†ŒüŒ£, ŒüŒ•Œ°ŒëŒùŒüŒ£, &amp;c. Not
only Œ†ŒùŒë, Œ†ŒóŒ°, Œ†ŒïŒ°, Œ†Œ°Œë, ŒúŒ°Œë (for Œ†ŒùŒïŒ•ŒúŒë, Œ†ŒëŒ§ŒóŒ°-Œ§ŒïŒ°-Œ§ŒïŒ°Œë,
ŒúŒóŒ§ŒïŒ°Œë), but also Œ£Œ§Œ°ŒòŒó, ŒôŒóŒõ, ŒôŒóŒõŒóŒú, for Œ£Œ§ŒëŒ•Œ°Œ©ŒòŒó, ŒôŒ£Œ°ŒëŒóŒõ,
ŒôŒïŒ°ŒüŒ•Œ£ŒëŒõŒóŒú.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But Cod. B, though familiar with ŒôŒ£, and a few other of
the most ordinary abbreviations, knows nothing of these
compendia: which certainly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> have existed in the earliest
copies of all. Once more, it seems reasonable to suppose
that their constant occurrence in Cod ◊ê indicates for
that Codex a date subsequent to Cod. B.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6) The very discrepancy observable between these two
Codices in their method of dealing with <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe last twelve
verses of S. Mark's Gospel,‚Äù</span> (already adverted to at p. <a href="#Pg088" class="tei tei-ref">88</a>,)
is a further indication, and as it seems to the present writer
a very striking one, that Cod. B is the older of the two.
Cod. ◊ê is evidently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">familiar</span></em> with the phenomenon which
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">astonishes</span></em> Cod. B by its novelty and strangeness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(7) But the most striking feature of difference, after all,
is only to be recognised by one who surveys the Codices
themselves with attention. It is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> general air of primitiveness
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page293">[pg 293]</span><a name="Pg293" id="Pg293" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in Cod. B which makes itself at once <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">felt</span></em>. The even
symmetry of the unbroken columns;‚Äîthe work of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">prima
manus</span></span> everywhere vanishing through sheer antiquity;‚Äîthe
small, even, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">square</span></em> writing, which partly recalls the style
of the Herculanean rolls; partly, the papyrus fragments
of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Oration against Demosthenes</span></span> (published by Harris in
1848):‚Äîall these notes of superior antiquity infallibly set
Cod. B before Cod. ◊ê; though it may be impossible to determine
whether by 50, by 75, or by 100 years.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. It has been conjectured by one whose words are always
entitled to most respectful attention, that Codex Sinaiticus
may have been <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúone of the fifty Codices of Holy Scripture
which Eusebius prepared <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 331, by Constantine's
direction, for the use of the new Capital.‚Äù</span> (Scrivener's
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Collation of the Cod. Sin.</span></span>, Introd. p. xxxvii-viii.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
1. But this, which is rendered improbable by the many
instances of grave discrepancy between its readings and
those with which Eusebius proves to have been most familiar,
is made impossible by the discovery that it is without
S. Mark xv. 28, which constitutes the Eusebian Section
numbered <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú216‚Äù</span> in S. Mark's Gospel. [Quite in vain has
Tischendorf perversely laboured to throw doubt on this circumstance.
It remains altogether undeniable,‚Äîas a far less
accomplished critic than Tischendorf may see at a glance.
Tischendorf's only plea is the fact that in Cod. M, (he
might have added and in the Codex Sinaiticus, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which explains
the phenomenon</span></em> in Cod. M), <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">against ver.</span></em> 29 is set the number,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú216,‚Äù</span> instead of against ver. 28. But what then? Has
not the number <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">demonstrably</span></em> lost its place? And is there
not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">still</span></em> one of the Eusebian Sections missing? And <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em>
can it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">possibly</span></em> have been, if it was not S. Mark xv. 28?]
Again. Cod. ◊ê, (like B, C, L, U, Œì, and some others), gives the
piercing of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> side at S. Matth. xxvii. 49: but if
Eusebius had read that incident in the same place, he would
have infallibly included S. John xix. 34, 35, with S. Matth.
xxvii. 49, in his vii<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
Canon, where matters are contained which are common to S. Matthew and S.
John,‚Äîinstead of referring S. John xix. 31-37 to his
x<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Canon, which
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page294">[pg 294]</span><a name="Pg294" id="Pg294" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
specifies things peculiar to each of the four Evangelists.
Eusebius, moreover, in a certain place (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Dem. Evan.</span></span> x. 8
[quoted by Tisch.]) has an allusion to the same transaction,
and expressly says that it is recorded <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">by S. John</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
2. No inference as to the antiquity of this Codex can be
drawn from the Eusebian notation of Sections in the margin:
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> notation having been confessedly added at a subsequent
date.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. On the other hand, the subdivision of Cod. ◊ê into paragraphs,
proves to have been made without any reference to
the sectional distribution of Eusebius. Thus, there are in
the Codex thirty distinct paragraphs from S. Matthew xi. 20
to xii. 34, inclusive; but there are comprised within the
same limits only seventeen Eusebian sections. And yet, of
those seventeen sections only nine correspond with as many
paragraphs of the Codex Sinaiticus. This, in itself, is enough
to prove that Eusebius knew nothing of the present Codex.
His record is express:‚Äî·ºêœÜ·æΩ ·ºêŒ∫·Ω±œÉœÑ·ø≥ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÑŒµœÉœÉ·Ω±œÅœâŒΩ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒª·Ω∑œâŒΩ
·ºÄœÅŒπŒ∏Œº·ΩπœÇ œÑŒπœÇ œÄœÅ·ΩπŒ∫ŒµŒπœÑŒ±Œπ Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞ Œº·Ω≥œÅŒøœÇ Œ∫.œÑ.Œª.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. The supposed resemblance of the opened volume to
an Egyptian papyrus,‚Äîwhen eight columns (œÉŒµŒª·Ω∑Œ¥ŒµœÇ) are
exhibited to the eye at once, side by side,‚Äîseems to be a fallacious
note of high antiquity. If Cod. ◊ê has four columns
in a page,‚ÄîCod. B three,‚ÄîCod. A two,‚ÄîCod. C has only
one. But Cod. C is certainly as old as Cod. A. Again,
Cod. D, which is of the vi<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
century, is written (like Cod. C)
across the page: yet was it <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúcopied from an older model
similarly divided in respect to the lines or verses,‚Äù</span>‚Äîand
therefore similarly written across the page. It is almost
obvious that the size of the skins on which a Codex was
written will have decided whether the columns should be
four or only three in a page.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
IV. In fine, nothing doubting the high antiquity of both
Codices, (B and ◊ê,) I am nevertheless fully persuaded that
an interval of at least half a century,‚Äîif not of a far greater
span of years,‚Äîis absolutely required to account for the
marked dissimilarity between them.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will be perceived from this, that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span> subdivides
these three portions of the sacred Narrative into ten Sections
(<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú¬ß¬ß;‚Äù</span>)‚Äîof which three belong to S. Matthew, viz.
¬ß¬ß 20, 21, 22:‚Äîthree to S. Mark, viz. ¬ß¬ß 9, 10, 11:‚Äîfour to
S. Luke, viz. ¬ß¬ß 29, 30, 31, 32: which ten Sections, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>
distributed over four of his Canons: referring three
of there to his II<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">nd</span></span> Canon,
(which exhibits what S. Matthew, S. Mark, and S. Luke have in common); four of them to
his VI<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Canon, (which shews what S. Matthew
and S. Mark have in common); one, to his IX<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>,
(which contains what is common to S. Luke and S. John); two, to his
X<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>, (in
which is found what is peculiar to each Evangelist.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now, the design which <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span> had in breaking up this
portion of the sacred Text, (S. Matth. iv. 18-22, S. Mark
i. 16-20, S. Luke v. 1-11,) after so arbitrary a fashion,
into ten portions; divorcing three of those Sections from
S. Matthew's Gospel, (viz. S. Luke's ¬ß¬ß 29, 30, 31); and
connecting one of these last three (¬ß 30) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with two Sections</span></em>
(¬ß¬ß 219, 222) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">of S. John;</span></em>‚Äîis perfectly plain. His object
was, (as he himself explains,) to shew‚Äînot only (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">a</span></span>) what
S. Matthew has in common with S. Mark and S. Luke; but also (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">b</span></span>)
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">what S. Luke has in common with S. John</span></em>;‚Äîas well
as (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">c</span></span>) what S. Luke has <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to himself</span></em>.
But, in the work of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as far as we know
anything about that work</span></em>, all this would have been simply impossible. (I have
already described his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiatessaron,‚Äù</span> at pp. <a href="#Pg126" class="tei tei-ref">126-7</a>.) Intent
on exhibiting the Sections of the other Gospels which correspond
with the Sections of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">S. Matthew</span></em>, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span> would
not if he could,‚Äî(and he could not if he would,)‚Äîhave dissociated
from its context S. Luke's account of the first
miraculous draught of fishes in the beginning of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span>
Ministry, for the purpose of establishing its resemblance to
S. John's account of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">second</span></em> miraculous draught of fishes
which took place after the Resurrection, and is only found
in S. John's Gospel. These Sections therefore are
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebian</span></span>,‚Äù</span>
not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ammonian</span></em>. They are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">necessary</span></em>, according to the
scheme of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>. They are not only unnecessary and
even meaningless, but actually impossible, in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonian</span></span>
scheme.

a more convincing instance. I am content in fact to narrow
the whole question to the following single issue:‚ÄîLet me
be shewn how it is rationally conceivable that <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>
can have split up S. John xxi. 12, 13, into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three distinct Sections</span></em>;
and S. John xxi. 15, 16, 17, into <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">six?</span></em> and yet, after
so many injudicious disintegrations of the sacred Text, how
it is credible that he can have made but <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> Section of
S. John xxi. 18 to 25,‚Äîwhich nevertheless, from its very
varied contents, confessedly requires even <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">repeated</span></em> subdivision?...
Why <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span> did all this, is abundantly plain.
His peculiar plan constrained him to refer the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">former</span></em> half
of ver. 12,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latter</span></em> half of verses 15, 16, 17‚Äîto his
IX<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span>
Canon, where S. Luke and S. John are brought together;
(·ºêŒΩ ·æß Œø·º± Œ¥·ΩªŒø œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±Œ∫Œª·ΩµœÉŒπŒ± Œµ·º∞œÅ·ΩµŒ∫Œ±œÉŒπ):‚Äîand to consign the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">latter</span></em> half of ver. 12,‚Äîthe <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">former</span></em>
half of verses 15, 16, 17,‚Äîtogether with the whole of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">last eight
verses</span></em> of S. John's Gospel, to his
X<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> (or last) Canon, where what is peculiar
to each of the four Evangelists is set down, (·ºêŒΩ ·æß œÄŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑ·Ω∑ŒΩœâŒΩ
·ºïŒ∫Œ±œÉœÑŒøœÇ Œ±·ΩêœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ ·º∞Œ¥·Ω∑œâœÇ ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω≥Œ≥œÅŒ±œàŒµŒΩ.) But <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>, because
he confessedly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">recognised no such Canons</span></em>, was under no such
constraint. He had in fact <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no such opportunity</span></em>. He therefore
simply <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> have adopted the same extraordinary
sectional subdivision.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
3. To state the matter somewhat differently, and perhaps
to exhibit the argument in a more convincing form:‚ÄîThe
Canons of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>, and the so-called
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonian </span><em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic; font-variant: small-caps">Sections</span></em></span>,‚Äù</span>‚Äî(by
which, confessedly, nothing else whatever is
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">meant</span></em> but the Sections of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>,)‚Äîare
discovered mutually to imply one another. Those Canons are without
meaning or use apart from the Sections,‚Äîfor the sake of
which they were clearly invented. Those Sections, whatever
convenience they may possess apart from the Canons, nevertheless
are discovered to presuppose the Canons throughout:
to be manifestly subsequent to them in order of time: to
depend upon them for their very existence: in some places
to be even unaccountable in the eccentricity of their arrangement,
except when explained by the requirements of
the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebian</span></span> Canons. I say‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">That</span></em>
particular sectional subdivision,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page298">[pg 298]</span><a name="Pg298" id="Pg298" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
in other words, to which the epithet <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonian</span></span>‚Äù</span>
is popularly applied,‚Äî(applied however without authority,
and in fact by the merest license,)‚Äîproves on careful inspection
to have been only capable of being devised by one
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">who was already in possession of the Canons of
</span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span></em>. In plain terms, they are
demonstrably <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the work of </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">
himself</span></em>,‚Äîwho expressly claims <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">The Canons</span></em> for his own (Œ∫Œ±ŒΩ·ΩπŒΩŒ±œÇ
Œ¥·Ω≥Œ∫Œ± œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ ·ºÄœÅŒπŒ∏Œº·Ω∏ŒΩ Œ¥ŒπŒµœá·Ω±œÅŒ±Œæ·Ω± œÉŒøŒπ), and leaves it to be
inferred that he is the Author of the Sections also. Wetstein
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proleg.</span></span> p. 70,) and Bishop Lloyd (in the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMonitum‚Äù</span>
prefixed to his ed. of the Greek Test. p. x,) so understand
the matter; and Mr. Scrivener (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Introduction</span></span>, p. 51) evidently
inclines to the same opinion.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
II. I desire, in the next place, to point out that a careful
inspection of the Eusebian <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections,‚Äù</span> (for Eusebius himself
calls them œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄŒ±·Ω∑, not Œ∫ŒµœÜ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒ±,) leads inevitably to the
inference that they are only rightly understood when regarded
in the light of <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Marginal References</span></span>.‚Äù</span> This has
been hitherto overlooked. Bp. Lloyd, in the interesting
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMonitum‚Äù</span> already quoted, remarks of the Eusebian Canons,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúquorum
haec est utilitas, ut eorum scilicet ope quivis,
nullo labore, Harmoniam sibi quatuor Evangeliorum possit
conficere.‚Äù</span> The learned Prelate can never have made the
attempt in this way <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHarmoniam sibi conficere,‚Äù</span> or he
would not have so written. He evidently did not advert to
the fact that Eusebius refers his readers (in his
III<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">rd</span></span> Canon)
from S. John's account of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Healing of the Nobleman's son</span></em>
to the account given by S. Matthew and S. Luke of the
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Healing of the Centurion's servant</span></em>. It is perfectly plain in fact
that to enable a reader <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúto construct for himself <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a Harmony
of the Gospels</span></em>,‚Äù</span> was no part of Eusebius' intention;
and quite certain that any one who shall ever attempt to
avail himself of the system of Sections and Canons before us
with that object, will speedily find himself landed in hopeless
confusion.<a id="noteref_543" name="noteref_543" href="#note_543"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">543</span></span></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But in fact there is no danger of his making much progress
in his task. His first discovery would probably be
that S. John's weighty doctrinal statements concerning our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Eternal </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span><span style="font-style: italic">head</span></em>

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Human Genealogy</span></em> of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> as recorded by
S. Matthew i. 1-16, and by S. Luke
iii. 23-38:‚Äîthe next, that the first half of the Visit of
the Magi (S. Matthew ii. 1-6) is exhibited as corresponding
with S. John vii. 41, 42.‚ÄîTwo such facts ought to open
the eyes of a reader of ordinary acuteness quite wide to
the true nature of the Canons of Eusebius. They are <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Tables
of Reference only</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Eusebius has in fact himself explained his object in constructing
them; which (he says) was twofold: (1<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">st</span></span>) To enable
a reader to see at a glance, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">which</span></em> of the Evangelists
have said <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">things of the same kind</span></em>,‚Äù</span> (œÑ·Ω∑ŒΩŒµœÇ œÑ·Ω∞ œÄŒ±œÅŒ±œÄŒª·ΩµœÉŒπŒ±

short Epistle): and (2<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">ndly</span></span>), To
enable him to find out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">where</span></em>
they have severally done so: (œÑŒø·Ω∫œÇ Œø·º∞Œ∫Œµ·Ω∑ŒøœÖœÇ ·ºëŒ∫·Ω±œÉœÑŒøœÖ Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥ŒµŒªŒπœÉœÑŒø·ø¶

(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">g.</span></span>) I was about to say that scarcely could such an excuse

I perceive that the same three References stand in the
margin of our own Bibles. Not even the margin of the
English Bible, however, sends a Reader (as the
IX<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> Canon
of Eusebius does) from our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> eating <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúbroiled fish and

this may suffice.

It is at all events certain that the correctest notion of the
use and the value of the Eusebian Sections will be obtained
by one who will be at the pains to substitute for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Eusebian
Numbers</span></em> in the margin of a copy of the Greek Gospels <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the
References</span></em> which these numbers severally indicate. It will
then become plain that the system of Sections and Canons
which Eusebius invented,‚Äîingenious, interesting, and useful
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page301">[pg 301]</span><a name="Pg301" id="Pg301" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

precious occasionally for critical purposes,<a id="noteref_545" name="noteref_545" href="#note_545"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">545</span></span></a>‚Äîis nothing else
but a clumsy substitute for what is achieved by an ordinary
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúReference Bible‚Äù</span>:‚Äîparticipating in every inconvenience
incidental to the unskilfully contrived apparatus with which
English readers are familiar,<a id="noteref_546" name="noteref_546" href="#note_546"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">546</span></span></a> and yet inferior in the following
four respects:‚Äî
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(1st.) The references of Eusebius, (except those found in
Canon X.), require in every instance to be <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">deciphered</span></em>, before
they can be verified; and they can only be deciphered by
making search, (and sometimes laborious search,) in another
part of the volume. They are not, in fact, (nor do they pretend
to be,) references to the inspired Text at all; but
only <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">references to the Eusebian Canons</span></em>.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(2ndly.) In their scope, they are of course strictly <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">confined
to the Gospels</span></em>,‚Äîwhich most inconveniently limits their use,
as well as diminishes their value. (Thus, by no possibility is
Eusebius able to refer a reader from S. Luke xxii. 19, 20 to
1 Cor. xi. 23-25.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(3rdly.) By the very nature of their constitution, reference
even to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another part of the same Gospel</span></em> is impossible. (Eusebius
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page302">[pg 302]</span><a name="Pg302" id="Pg302" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is unable, for example, to refer a reader from S. John
xix. 39, to iii. 1 and vii. 50.)
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
But besides the preceding, which are disadvantages inherent
in the scheme and inseparable from it, it will be found
(4thly), That Eusebius, while he introduces not a few wholly
undesirable references, (of which some specimens are supplied
above), is observed occasionally to withhold references
which cannot by any means be dispensed with. Thus, he
omits to refer his reader from S. Luke's account of the visit
to the Sepulchre (chap. xxiv. 12) to S. John's memorable account
of the same transaction (chap. xx. 3-10): <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">not</span></em> because
he disallowed the verse in S. Luke's Gospel,‚Äîfor in a certain
place <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">he discusses its statements</span></em>.<a id="noteref_547" name="noteref_547" href="#note_547"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">547</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
III. It is abundantly plain from all that has gone before
that the work of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span> was entirely different in its
structure and intention from the work of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>. Enough, in
fact, has been said to make it fully apparent that it is
nothing short of impossible that there can have been any
extensive correspondence between the two. According to
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>, S. Mark has 21
Sections<a id="noteref_548" name="noteref_548" href="#note_548"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">548</span></span></a> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar to his
Gospel</span></em>: S. Luke, 72: S. John, 97.<a id="noteref_549" name="noteref_549" href="#note_549"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">549</span></span></a> According to the same <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span>,
14 Sections<a id="noteref_550" name="noteref_550" href="#note_550"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">550</span></span></a> are common to S.
Luke and S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>: 21, to S. Luke and S. John <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em>.
But those 225 Sections can have found <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no place</span></em> in the work of
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>. And if, (in some unexplained way,) room
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">was</span></em> found for those parts of the Gospels, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">with what possible
motive can </span><span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span><span style="font-style: italic"> have subdivided
them into exactly 225 portions</span></em>? It is nothing else but
irrational to assume that he did so.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Not unaware am I that it has been pointed out by a most
judicious living Critic as a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúground for hesitation before we
ascribe the Sections as well as the Canons to Eusebius, that
not a few ancient MSS. contain the former while they omit
the latter.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_551" name="noteref_551" href="#note_551"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">551</span></span></a> He considers it to be certainly indicated

(whatever that judgment may be deemed worth,) the Ammonian
Sections had a previous existence to the Eusebian
Canons, as well as served for an independent purpose.‚Äù</span> But
I respectfully demur to the former of the two proposed inferences.
I also learn with surprise that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthose who have

However irregular and arbitrary these subdivisions of the
Evangelical text are observed to be in their construction,
their usefulness is paramount. They are observed to fulfil
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">exactly the same office</span></em> as our own actual division of the Text
into 89 Chapters and 3780 Verses. Of course, 1165 subdivisions
are (for certain purposes) somewhat less convenient
than 3780;‚Äîbut on the other hand, a place in the Gospels
would be more easily discovered, I suspect, for the most part,
by the employment of such a single set of consecutive numbers,
than by requiring a Reader first to find the Chapter by
its Roman numeral, and then the Verse by its Arabic figure.
Be this as it may, there can be at least only one opinion as
to the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">supreme convenience to a Reader</span></em>, whether ancient or
modern, of knowing that the copy of the Gospels which he
holds in his hands is subdivided into exactly the same 1165
Sections as every other Greek copy which is likely to come
in his way; and that, in every such copy, he may depend on
finding every one of those sections invariably distinguished
by the self-same number.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
A Greek copy of the Gospels, therefore, having its margin
furnished with the Eusebian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sectional</span></em> notation, may be considered
to correspond generally with an English copy merely
divided into Chapters and Verses. The addition of the
Eusebian <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Canons</span></em> at the beginning, with numerical references
thereto inserted in the margin throughout, does but
superadd something analogous to the convenience of our
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Marginal References</span></em>,‚Äîand may just as reasonably (or just as
unreasonably) be dispensed with.

I think it not improbable, in fact, that in the preparation
of a Codex, it will have been sometimes judged commercially
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page304">[pg 304]</span><a name="Pg304" id="Pg304" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
expedient to leave its purchaser to decide whether he would
or would not submit to the additional expense (which in the
case of illuminated MSS. must have been very considerable)
of having the Eusebian Tables inserted at the commencement
of his Book,<a id="noteref_553" name="noteref_553" href="#note_553"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">553</span></span></a>‚Äîwithout
which <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the References</span></em> thereto would
confessedly have been of no manner of avail. In this way it
will have come to pass, (as Mr. Scrivener points out,) that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúnot a few ancient MSS. contain the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sections</span></em> but omit the

the Canons in Copies which retain in the margin the sectional

not,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>,
at all events, will have had no more to do with
either the one or the other, than with our modern division
into Chapters and Verses. It is, in short, nothing else but
a <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúvulgar error‚Äù</span> to designate the Eusebian Sections as the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúSections of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Ammonius</span></span>.‚Äù</span> The expression cannot be too

As already remarked, the necessity of resorting to the
Eusebian Tables of Canons in order to make any use of
a marginal reference, is a tedious and a cumbersome process;
for which, men must have early sought to devise a remedy.
They were not slow in perceiving that a far simpler expedient
would be to note at the foot of every page of a Gospel
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the numbers</span></em> of the Sections of that Gospel contained
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">in extenso</span></span>

exhibit the numbers of the corresponding Sections in the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page305">[pg 305]</span><a name="Pg305" id="Pg305" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

instance, in Cod. 262 (= Reg. 53, at Paris), which is written

The owner of such a MS. was able to refer to parallel passages,

V. I suspect that this peculiar method of exhibiting the

was derived to the Greek Church from the Syrian Christians.
What is certain, a precisely similar expedient for
enabling readers to discover <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Parallel Passages</span></em> prevails extensively
in the oldest Syriac Evangelia extant. There are in

The Syrian Church, therefore, from a period of the remotest
antiquity, not only subdivided the Gospels into a far
greater number of Sections than were in use among the
Greeks, but also habitually employed Eusebian Tables which‚Äîidentical
as they are in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appearance</span></em> and in <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the principle</span></em>

Let abler men follow up this inquiry to its lawful results.
When the extreme antiquity of the Syriac documents is considered,
may it not almost be made a question whether
Eusebius himself put forth the larger or the smaller number
of Sections? But however <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> may be, more palpably precarious
than ever, I venture to submit, becomes the confident
assertion of the Critics that, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äújust as <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Eusebius</span></span> found these
Verses [S. Mark xvi. 9-20] absent in his day from the best

VI. Birch [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Varr. Lectt.</span></span> p. 226], asserts that in the best

Codices extant at Constantinople about <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 500. That the
corruption of the text of S. Matthew's Gospel under review
is ancient therefore, and was once very widely spread, is
certain. The question remains,‚Äîand this is the only point
to be determined,‚ÄîHow did it <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">originate</span></em>?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Now it must be candidly admitted, that if the strange
method of the Lectionaries already explained, (viz. of interposing
seven verses of S. John's xix<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="vertical-align: super">th</span></span> chapter [ver. 31-7]
between the 54th and 55th verses of S. Matth. xxvii,) really
were the occasion of this interpolation of S. John xix. 34
after S. Matth. xxvii. 48 or 49,‚Äîtwo points would seem to
call for explanation which at present remain unexplained:
First, (1) Why does <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only that one verse</span></em> find place in the interpolated
copies? And next, (2) How does it come to pass
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page316">[pg 316]</span><a name="Pg316" id="Pg316" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
that <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> one verse is exhibited in so very depraved and so
peculiar a form?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
For, to say nothing of the inverted order of the two
principal words, (which is clearly due to 1 S. John v. 6,)
let it be carefully noted that the substitution of ·ºÑŒªŒªŒøœÇ Œ¥·Ω≤
ŒªŒ±Œ≤·ΩΩŒΩ Œª·ΩπŒ≥œáŒ∑ŒΩ, for ·ºÄŒªŒª·æΩ Œµ·º∂œÇ œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒπœâœÑ·ø∂ŒΩ Œª·ΩπŒ≥œá·øÉ of the
Evangelist, is a tell-tale circumstance. The turn thus licentiously
given to the narrative clearly proceeded from
some one who was bent on weaving incidents related by
different writers into a connected narrative, and who was
sometimes constrained to take liberties with his Text in
consequence. (Thus, S. Matthew having supplied the fact
that <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">ONE OF THEM</span></span> ran, and <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">took a sponge</span></em>,
and filled it with vinegar, and put it on a reed, and gave Him to drink,‚Äù</span>
S. John is made to say, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">And another</span></span>‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">took a
spear</span></em>.‚Äù</span>)
Now, this is exactly what Tatian is related by Eusebius to
have done: viz. <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúafter some fashion of his own, to have composed
out of the four Gospels one connected narrative.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_576" name="noteref_576" href="#note_576"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">576</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When therefore, (as in the present Scholion,) an ancient
Critic who appears to have been familiarly acquainted with
the lost <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiatessaron‚Äù</span> of Tatian, comes before us with the
express declaration that in that famous monument of the
primitive age (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 173), S. John's record of the piercing
of our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour's</span></span> side was thrust into S. Matthew's History
of the Passion in this precise way and in these very terms,‚Äî(for,
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúNote,‚Äù</span> he says, <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThat into the Evangelical History
of Diodorus, of Tatian, and of divers other holy Fathers,
is introduced [here] the following addition: <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄòAnd another
took a spear and pierced His side, and there came out Water
and Blood.‚Äô</span> This, Chrysostom also says‚Äù</span>),‚Äîit is even unreasonable
to seek for any other explanation of the vitiated
text of our two oldest Codices. Not only is the testimony
to the critical fact abundantly sufficient, but the proposed
solution of the difficulty, in itself the reverse of improbable,
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page317">[pg 317]</span><a name="Pg317" id="Pg317" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
is in the highest degree suggestive as well as important.
For,‚ÄîMay we not venture to opine that the same Œ∫Œ±Œ∏·æΩ ·º±œÉœÑŒøœÅ·Ω∑Œ±ŒΩ
Œµ·ΩêŒ±Œ≥Œ≥·Ω≥ŒªŒπŒøŒΩ,‚Äîas this Writer aptly designates Tatian's
work,‚Äîis responsible for not a few of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">monstra potius
quam variae lectiones</span></span><a id="noteref_577" name="noteref_577" href="#note_577"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">577</span></span></a>
which are occasionally met with in
the earliest MSS. of all? And,‚ÄîAm I not right in suggesting
that the circumstance before us is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the only thing
we know for certain</span></em> about the text of Tatian's (miscalled)
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúHarmony?‚Äù</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
To conclude.‚ÄîThat the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiatessaron‚Äù</span> of Tatian, (for so,
according to Eusebius and Theodoret, Tatian himself styled
it,) has long since disappeared, no one now
doubts.<a id="noteref_578" name="noteref_578" href="#note_578"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">578</span></span></a> That
Eusebius himself, (who lived 150 years after the probable
date of its composition,) had never seen it, may I suppose be
inferred from the terms in which he speaks of it. Jerome
does not so much as mention its existence. Epiphanius,
who is very full and particular concerning the heresy of
Tatian, affords no indication that he was acquainted with
his work. On the contrary. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThe Diatessaron Gospel,‚Äù</span>
(he remarks in passing,) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúwhich some call the Gospel according
to the Hebrews, is said to have been the production
of this writer.‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_579" name="noteref_579" href="#note_579"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">579</span></span></a> The most interesting notice we have of
Tatian's work is from the pen of Theodoret. After explaining
that Tatian the Syrian, originally a Sophist, and next
a disciple of Justin Martyr [<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 150], after Justin's death
aspired to being a heretical leader,‚Äî(statements which are
first found in Iren√¶us,)‚ÄîTheodoret enumerates his special
tenets. <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúThis man‚Äù</span> (he proceeds) <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúput together the so-called
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Diatessaron Gospel</span></em>,‚Äîfrom which he cut away the
genealogies, and whatever else shews that the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord</span></span> was
born of the seed of David. The book was used not only by
those who favoured Tatian's opinions, but by the orthodox
as well; who, unaware of the mischievous spirit in which
the work had been executed, in their simplicity used the
book as an epitome. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">I myself found upwards of two hundred
such copies honourably preserved in the Churches of this place</span></em>,‚Äù</span>
(Cyrus in Syria namely, of which Theodoret was made
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page318">[pg 318]</span><a name="Pg318" id="Pg318" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
Bishop, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 423,)‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúall of which I

The diocese of Theodoret (he says) contained eight hundred
Parishes.<a id="noteref_581" name="noteref_581" href="#note_581"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">581</span></span></a> It cannot be thought surprising that a work of
which copies had been multiplied to such an extraordinary
extent, and which was evidently once held in high esteem,
should have had <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">some</span></em> influence on the text of the earliest
Codices; and here, side by side with a categorical statement
as to one of its licentious interpolations, we are furnished
with documentary proof that many an early MS. also was
infected with the same taint. To assume that the two phenomena
stand related to one another in the way of cause
and effect, seems to be even an inevitable proceeding.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
I will not prolong this note by inquiring concerning the
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúDiodorus‚Äù</span> of whom the unknown author of this scholion
speaks: but I suppose it was <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">that</span></em> Diodorus who was made
Bishop of Tarsus in <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">A.D.</span></span> 378. He is related to have been
the preceptor of Chrysostom; was a very voluminous writer;
and, among the rest, according to Suidas, wrote a work <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúon

the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Redeemer's</span></span> side? Is it allowable to conjecture that,
indirectly, the Diatessaron of Tatian may have been the
occasion of that circumstance also; as well as of certain
other similar phenomena in the Evangeliaria?

But to accept the proposed inference from it, is impossible.
It ought to be obvious to every thoughtful person
that problems of this class will not bear to be so handled.
It is as if one were to apply the rigid mathematical method
to the ordinary transactions of daily life, for which
it is clearly unsuitable. Before we move a single step,
however, we desire a few more particulars concerning this
supposed evidence of Eusebius.

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(4.) Now, the chief thing deserving of attention here,‚Äîthe
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">only</span></em> thing in fact which I am concerned to point out,‚Äîis
the notable circumstance that the supposed dictum of
Eusebius,‚Äî(<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúquod scribere non potuisset si pericopam dubiam
agnovisset,‚Äù</span>)‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">is no longer discoverable</span></em>. To say that
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúit has disappeared,‚Äù</span> would be incorrect. In the original
document <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">it has no existence</span></em>. In plain terms, the famous
<span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúœÉœá·ΩπŒªŒπŒøŒΩ Œµ·ΩêœÉŒµŒ≤·Ω∑ŒøœÖ‚Äù</span> proves to be every way a figment. It
is a worthless interpolation, thrust by some nameless scribe
into his abridgement of a Scholion, of which Eusebius (as
I shall presently shew) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">cannot</span></em> have been the Author.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(5.) I may as well point out <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">why</span></em> the person who wrote
the longer Scholion says nothing about S. Mark's Gospel.
It is because there was nothing for him to say.
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page322">[pg 322]</span><a name="Pg322" id="Pg322" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
He is enumerating our <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Lord's</span></span> <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">appearances to His
Disciples</span></em> after His Resurrection; and he discovers that these
were exactly seven in number: <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one</span></em> being peculiar to S.
Matthew,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>, to S. John,‚Äî<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">three</span></em>, to S.
Luke. But because, (as every one is aware), there exists <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">no</span></em>
record of an appearance to the Disciples <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">peculiar</span></em> to S. Mark's Gospel,
the Author of the Scholion is silent concerning S. Mark <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">perforce</span></em>....
How so acute and accomplished a Critic as Matthaei
can have overlooked all this: how he can have failed to recognise
the identity of his longer and his shorter Scholion:
how he came to say of the latter, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúconjicias ergo Eusebium
hunc totum locum repudiasse;‚Äù</span> and, of the former, <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúultimam
partem Evangelii Marci videtur

lastly, how Tischendorf (1869) can write,‚Äî<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúest enim ejusmodi ut
ultimam partem evangelii Marci, de quo quaeritur,
excludat:‚Äù</span><a id="noteref_584" name="noteref_584" href="#note_584"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">584</span></span></a>‚ÄîI profess myself unable to understand.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(6.) The epitomizer however, missing the point of his
Author,‚Äîbesides enumerating <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">all</span></em> the appearances of our
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">Saviour</span></span> which S. Luke anywhere records,‚Äîis further
convicted of having injudiciously <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invented</span></em> the negative statement
about S. Mark's Gospel which is occasioning us all
this trouble.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(7.) And yet, by that unlucky sentence of his, he certainly
did not mean what is commonly imagined. I am not concerned
to defend him: but it is only fair to point out that,
to suppose he intended <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">to disallow the end of S. Mark's Gospel</span></em>,
is altogether to misapprehend the gist of his remarks, and
to impute to him a purpose of which he clearly knew nothing.
Note, how he throws his first two statements into
a separate paragraph; contrasts, and evidently <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">balances</span></em> one
against the other: thus,‚Äî

(8.) And on passing the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúQuaestiones ad Marinum‚Äù</span>
of Eusebius under review, I am constrained to admit that
the Scholion before us is just such a clumsy bit of writing
as an unskilful person might easily be betrayed into, who
should attempt to exhibit in a few short sentences the substance
of more than one tedious disquisition of this ancient
Father.<a id="noteref_585" name="noteref_585" href="#note_585"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">585</span></span></a> Its remote parentage would fully account for its

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(9.) Least of all am I concerned to say anything more
about the longer Scholion; seeing that S. Mark is not so
much as mentioned in it. But I may as well point out that,
<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">as it stands</span></em>, Eusebius cannot have been its Author: the
proof being, that whereas the Scholion in question is a note
on S. John xxi. 12, (as Matthaei is careful to inform us,)‚Äîits
opening sentence is derived <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">from Chrysostom's Commentary
on that same verse</span></em> in his 87th Homily on S. John.<a id="noteref_586" name="noteref_586" href="#note_586"><span class="tei tei-noteref"><span style="font-size: 60%; vertical-align: super">586</span></span></a>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
(10.) And thus, one by one, every imposing statement of
the Critics is observed hopelessly to collapse as soon as it
is questioned, and to vanish into thin air.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So much has been offered, only because of the deliberate
pledge I gave in p. <a href="#Pg051" class="tei tei-ref">51</a>.‚ÄîNever again, I undertake to say,
will the <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúScholion of Eusebius‚Äù</span> which has cost my friend
at Moscow, his Archimandrites, and me, so much trouble, be
introduced into any discussion of the genuineness of the last
Twelve Verses of the Gospel according to S. Mark. As the
oversight of one (C. F. Matthaei) who was singularly accurate,
and towards whom we must all feel as towards a Benefactor,
let it be freely forgiven as well as loyally forgotten!

Index of Texts that can be named. To judge from the Index in Oehler's edition of
Tertullian, that Father quotes these twelve verses not less than eight times.
According to the Benedictine Index, Ambrose does not quote them so much
as once. Ambrose, nevertheless, quotes five of these verses no less than fourteen
times; while Tertullian, as far as I am able to discover, does not quote
S. Mark xvi. 9-20 at all.

Of these 437 readings and notes, 91 are not found in White's Edition; while
105 (the supplement in question being one of them) are found in White only.
This creates a suspicion that in part at least the Philoxenian margin must
exhibit traces of the assiduity of subsequent critics of the Syriac text. (So
Adler on S. Matth. xxvi. 40.) To understand the character of some of those

inasmuch as their compilers are observed to have been very curious in such questions,
are evidently full of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">disjecta membra</span></span> of the work. These are
recognisable for the most part by their form; but sometimes they actually retain the name
of their author. Accordingly, Caten√¶ have furnished Mai with a considerable body of
additional materials; which (as far as a MS. Catena of Nicetas on S. Luke, [Cod. A.
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">seu</span></span> Vat. 1611,] enabled him,) he has edited with considerable
industry; throwing them into a kind of Supplement. (Vol. iv. pp. 268-282, and pp.
283-298.) It is only surprising that with the stores at his command, Mai has not
contrived to enlighten us a little more on this curious subject. It would not be
difficult to indicate sundry passages which he has overlooked. Neither indeed can it be
denied that the learned Cardinal has executed his task in a somewhat slovenly manner.
He does not seem to have noticed that what he quotes at pp.
357-8‚Äî262‚Äî283‚Äî295, is to be found in the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catena</span></span>

quotes (p. 300) from an unedited Homily of John Xiphilinus, (<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Cod.

He was evidently unacquainted with Cramer's work, though it had been published
3 (if not 7) years before his own,‚Äîelse, at p. 299, instead of quoting
Simon, he would have quoted Cramer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Caten√¶</span></span>, i. 266.‚ÄîIt was
in his power to solve his own shrewd doubt, (at p. 299,‚Äîconcerning the text of a
passage in Possinus, p. 343,) seeing that the Catena which Possinus published was
transcribed by Corderius from a MS. in the Vatican. (Possini
<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Pr√¶fat.</span></span> p. ii.) In the Vatican, too, he might have found
the fragment he quotes (p. 300) from p. 364 of the <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catena</span></span>
of Possinus. In countless places he might, by

Œ§·Ω¥ŒΩ œÑŒø·ø¶œÑŒø œÜ·Ω±œÉŒ∫ŒøœÖœÉŒ±ŒΩ œÄŒµœÅŒπŒ∫ŒøœÄ·ΩµŒΩ is probably a gloss, explanatory of œÑ·Ω∏ Œ∫ŒµœÜ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ
Œ±·ΩêœÑ·Ωπ. In strictness, the Œ∫ŒµœÜ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒøŒΩ begins at ch. xv. 42, and extends to the end
of the Gospel. There are 48 such Œ∫ŒµœÜ·Ω±ŒªŒ±ŒπŒ± in S. Mark. But this term was

So Victor of Antioch, in his Catena on S. Mark (ed. Possin.) He makes the
remark twice: first (p. 351) in the midst of an abridgment of the beginning of
Chrysostom's 88th Homily on S. Matthew: next (p. 352) more fully, after quoting
<span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúthe great Dionysius‚Äù</span> of Alexandria. See also an interesting passage on
the same subject in Cramer's <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Catena in Matth.</span></span> i. p.

(Note, that the 10 lines ·ºêŒæ ·ºÄŒΩŒµœÄŒπŒ≥œÅ·Ω±œÜŒøœÖ, beginning p. 236, line 33 = Chrys. vii. 824,

its structure minutely at vol. i. pp. 309-310, and from pp. 312-7; 318-321.
[Note, by the way, the gross blunder which has crept into the printed text of
Epiphanius at p. 321 <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">d</span></span>: pointed out long since by
Jones, <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">On the Canon</span></span>, ii. 38.] His plan is excellent. Marcion had
rejected every Gospel except S. Luke's, and of S. Paul's Epistles had retained only
ten,‚Äîviz. (1st) Galatians, (2nd and 3rd) I and II Corinthians, (4th) Romans,
(5th and 6th) I and II Thessalonians, (7th) <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephesians</span></em>, (8th) Colossians,
(9th) Philemon, (10th) Philippians. Even these he had mutilated and depraved.
And yet out of that one mutilated Gospel, Epiphanius selects 78 passages,
(pp. 312-7), and out of those ten mutilated Epistles, 40 passages more (pp. 318-21);
by means of which 118 texts he undertakes to refute the heresy of
Marcion. (pp. 322-50: 350-74.) [It will be perceived that Tertullian goes
over Marcion's work in much the same way.] Very beautiful, and well worthy
of the student's attention, (though it comes before us in a somewhat incorrect
form,) is the remark of Epiphanius concerning the living energy of

<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">another</span></em> difficulty, and leaves the question of the reading of Ephes. i. 1
untouched. It proposes only to explain what S. Paul means by the enigmatical expression
which is found in Col. iv. 16.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Macknight's suggestion, though it has found favour with many subsequent
Divines, appears to me improbable in a high degree. S. Paul is found not to
have sent <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Colossians</span></em> <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúword by Tychicus, who carried their letter, to
send a copy of it to the Laodiceans.‚Äù</span> He charged them, himself, to do so. Why,
at the same instant, is the Apostle to be thought to have adopted two such
different methods of achieving one and the same important end? And why,
instead of this roundabout method of communication, were not <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the Ephesians</span></em>
ordered,‚Äîif not by S. Paul himself, at least by Tychicus,‚Äîto send a copy of
their Epistle to Colosse direct? And why do we find the Colossians charged
to read publicly œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ ŒõŒ±ŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑Œ±œÇ, which (by the hypothesis) would have been
only a copy,‚Äîinstead of œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒæ ·ºòœÜ·Ω≥œÉŒøœÖ, which, (by the same hypothesis,) would
have been the original? Nay, why is it not designated by S. Paul, œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ œÄœÅ·Ω∏œÇ
·ºòœÜŒµœÉ·Ω∑ŒøœÖœÇ,‚Äî(if indeed it was his Epistle to the Ephesians which is alluded to,)
instead of œÑ·Ω¥ŒΩ ·ºêŒ∫ ŒõŒ±ŒøŒ¥ŒπŒ∫Œµ·Ω∑Œ±œÇ; which would hardly be an intelligible way of
indicating the document? Lastly, why are not the Colossians ordered to communicate
a copy of their Epistle to the illustrious Church of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Ephesians</span></em>
also, which had been originally addressed by S. Paul? If the Colossians must
needs read the Epistle (so like their own) which the Apostle had just written
to the Ephesians, surely the Ephesians must also be supposed to have required
a sight of the Epistle which S. Paul had at the same time written to the
Colossians!</p></dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_183" name="note_183" href="#noteref_183">183.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext">Epiphan. <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Opp.</span></span> i. 311 D.</dd><dt class="tei tei-notelabel"><a id="note_184" name="note_184" href="#noteref_184">184.</a></dt><dd class="tei tei-notetext"><span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúMarcion

And now, with the evidence thus all before us, will any one say that it is
lawfully a question for discussion which of these two readings must exhibit the
genuine text of S. John i. 4? (For I treat it as a question of authority, and

On inspection, these four readings prove to be exactly what might have been
anticipated from the announcement that they are almost the private property
of the single Codex ◊ê. The last three are absolutely worthless. They stand
self-condemned. To examine is to reject them: the second (of which Jerome
says something <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">very</span></em> different from what Tisch. pretends) and fourth being
only two more of those unskilful attempts at critical emendation of the inspired
Text, of which this Codex contains so many sorry specimens: the third being
clearly nothing else but the result of the carelessness of the transcriber.

in appealing to the authority of Ammonius <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">in support</span></em> of the last

maintained for a moment, as Wetstein has convincingly shewn.
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Proleg.</span></span> p. 68.) Any one may easily satisfy himself of the
fact who will be at the pains to examine a few of the chapters with attention,
bearing in mind what Eusebius has said concerning the work of Ammonius.
Cap. lxxiv, for instance, contains as follows:‚ÄîMtt. xiii. 33, 34. Mk. iv. 33.
Mtt. xiii. 34, 35: 10, 11. Mk. iv. 34. Mtt. xiii. 13 to 17. But here it is

it is <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">invariably</span></em> rendered <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äú<em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sabbatum</span></em>‚Äù</span> in the Vulgate.)
Thus, in Exod. xvi. 23,‚ÄîœÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ± ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω±œÄŒ±œÖœÉŒπœÇ ·ºÅŒ≥·Ω∑Œ± œÑ·ø∑ ŒöœÖœÅ·Ω∑·ø≥: and 25,‚Äî·ºîœÉœÑŒπ Œ≥·Ω∞œÅ
œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ± ·ºÄŒΩ·Ω±œÄŒ±œÖœÉŒπœÇ œÑ·ø∑ ŒöœÖœÅ·Ω∑·ø≥. Again,‚ÄîœÑ·øá Œ¥·Ω≤ ·º°Œº·Ω≥œÅŒ± œÑ·øá ·ºëŒ≤Œ¥·ΩπŒºŒ∑ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ±. (Exod. xvi.
26: xxxi. 14. Levit. xxiii. 3.) And in the Gospel, what took place on <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">one
definite Sabbath-day</span></em>, is said to have occurred ·ºêŒΩ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπ (S. Luke xiii. 10.
S. Mark xii. 1.)
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It will, I believe, be invariably found that the form ·ºêŒΩ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπ is strictly
equivalent to ·ºêŒΩ œÑ·ø∑ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑ·ø≥; and was adopted for convenience in contradistinction
to ·ºêŒΩ œÑŒø·øñœÇ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑŒøŒπœÇ (1 Chron. xxiii. 31 and 2 Chron. ii. 4) where
Sabbath <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">days</span></em> are spoken of.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It is not correct to say that in Levit. xxiii. 15 ◊™◊ï◊™◊ë◊© is put for <span class="tei tei-q">‚Äúweeks;‚Äù</span>
though the Septuagint translators have (reasonably enough) there rendered the
word ·ºëŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒº·Ω±Œ¥Œ±œÇ. In Levit. xxv. 8, (where the same word occurs twice,) it is
once rendered ·ºÄŒΩŒ±œÄŒ±·ΩªœÉŒµŒπœÇ; once, ·ºëŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒº·Ω±Œ¥ŒµœÇ. Quite distinct is ◊¢◊ï◊ë◊©
(<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">shavooa</span></span>) i.e. ·ºëŒ≤Œ¥ŒøŒº·Ω±œÇ; nor is there any substitution of the
one word for the other. But inasmuch as the recurrence of the <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Sabbath-day</span></em>
was what constituted <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">a week</span></em>; in other words, since the essential
feature of a week, as a Jewish division of time, was the recurrence of the Jewish
day of rest;‚ÄîœÑ·Ω∏ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒøŒΩ or œÑ·Ω∞ œÉ·Ω±Œ≤Œ≤Œ±œÑŒ±, the Hebrew name for <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the day of
rest</span></em>, became transferred to <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the week</span></em>. The former designation,
(as explained in the text,) is used once by S. Mark, once by S. Luke; while the
phrase Œº·Ω∑Œ± œÑ·ø∂ŒΩ œÉŒ±Œ≤Œ≤·Ω±œÑœâŒΩ occurs in the N.T., in all, six times.

Thereupon, these individuals,‚Äî(the Liturgical attainments of nine-tenths
of whom it would be unbecoming in such an one as myself to characterise
truthfully,)‚Äîat once imposed upon themselves the duty of inventing <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">an
entirely new Lectionary for the Church of England</span></em>.
</p>
<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
So to mutilate the Word of <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-variant: small-caps">God</span></span> that it shall henceforth be
quite impossible to understand a single Bible story, or discover the sequence of a
single connected portion of narrative,‚Äîseems to have been the guiding principle of
their deliberations. With reckless eclecticism,‚Äîentire forgetfulness of the
requirements of the poor brother,‚Äîstrange disregard for Catholic Tradition and the
claims of immemorial antiquity;‚Äîthese Commissioners, (evidently unconscious
of their own unfitness for their self-imposed task,) have given us a Lectionary
which will recommend itself to none but the lovers of novelty,‚Äîthe
impatient,‚Äîand the enemies of Divine Truth.

That the blame, <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">the guilt</span></em> lies at the door of <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">our Bishops</span></em>,
is certain; but the Church has no one but herself to thank for the injury which has been
thus deliberately inflicted upon her. She has suffered herself to be robbed of her
ancient birthright without resistance; without remonstrance; without (in her
corporate capacity) so much as a word of audible dissatisfaction. <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">Can</span></em> it be
right in this way to defraud those who are to come after us of their lawful
inheritance?... I am amazed and grieved beyond measure at what is taking
place. At least, (as on other occasions,) <span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">liberavi animam meam</span></span>.

<span class="tei tei-hi"><span style="font-style: italic">Origeniana</span></span>, p. 274) states that there is in the Library of
C.C.C., Oxford, a Commentary on S. Mark's Gospel by Origen. The source of this
misstatement has been acutely pointed out to me by the Rev. W. R. Churton. James,
in his <span class="tei tei-q">‚ÄúEcloga Oxonio-Cantabrig.,‚Äù</span> (1600, lib. i. p. 49,) mentions

actually led Possevinus astray, I perceive, was James's consummation of his own
